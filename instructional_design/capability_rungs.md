| 6    | Nesting & Logic             | `CASE`, subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`                                   | Learn to apply conditional logic and basic subqueries.              | Classify customers into tiers based on total spend; **Stretch**: use a subquery to find above-average customers.            |
| 7    | Organizing Your SQL         | `WITH` (CTE), `QUALIFY`, `ROW_NUMBER()`                                   | Learn to structure queries and filter ranked results.               | Return each customer's latest order; **Stretch**: show only top 3 customers by spend per region.                            |
