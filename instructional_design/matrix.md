# üß≠ Snowflake SQL Workshop Roadmap

This full-day workshop is structured across two parts:

- **Part 1** builds baseline fluency and confidence in SQL querying, with dedicated exercises for beginners, intermediate, and advanced users.
- **Part 2** splits into three thematic learning tracks ‚Äî each deepening specific skill sets ‚Äî again offered at two specific capability-levels.
