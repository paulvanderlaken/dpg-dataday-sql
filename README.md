## 🧭 Workshop Format

The day is split into two parts:

### Part 1: 🔁 Self-Paced Ladder  
Work solo or in small groups through a progressive ladder of beginner and advanced exercises.  
Each challenge builds on the last — take your time, experiment, and try optional stretch goals if you're flying!

### Part 2: 🔀 Track-Based Mini-Challenges  
Choose your adventure:  
- 🔍 **The Data Detective** – Spot data anomalies, clean issues, reconcile mismatches  
- ⚙️ **The Query Optimizer** – Tune slow queries, cut Snowflake credit costs  
- 📊 **The Business Strategist** – Answer real-world business questions with elegant SQL

Each track is available at **Beginner** and **Advanced** levels — pick the one that suits your confidence and curiosity.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. Open **Snowflake Web UI** or your SQL editor.
2. Run your queries against:  
   `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1` (more [information](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/sample-data-tpch))
3. Pick any exercise file (`.md`) and read the business context.
4. Start solving in your editor — check the hint if needed.
5. Share insights with others, compare approaches, and reflect on performance.

**Pro tip:** Try estimating query cost using `EXPLAIN`, and think about how to make it more efficient.
