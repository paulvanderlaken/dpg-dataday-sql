## ex37: Append New Audit Flags for Duplicate Customer Records

> **Type:** Core | **Track:** SQL Detective  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
As the audit trail grows, new patterns of concern are emerging. This time, your stakeholders have noticed several customer accounts showing a **negative balance** ‚Äî which could point to data entry mistakes, invalid refunds, or untracked credit activity.

Your task is to:
- Identify customers with a negative balance
- Define your own **audit flag** and **status description**
- Insert those flags into the shared audit log using `status_id = 2`
- Return the table showing all flagged customers 

> üéØ This is a chance to define a flag that your stakeholders will **actually understand**. Use meaningful naming.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* A customer with `C_ACCTBAL < 0` should be flagged
* Reruns should clean out old `status_id = 2` entries first
- Then **summarize the full audit trail**, grouped by flag and description


### Starter code
```sql
-- Step 2: Add a new audit flag definition for negative balances

-- Delete previous status_id = 2 (clean rerun)
DELETE FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim WHERE status_id = 2;

-- ‚úèÔ∏è Replace the values below with your own meaningful label and description
INSERT INTO WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim (
    status_id,
    status_flag,
    status_description
) VALUES (
    2,
    '{insert your flag name}}',  -- replace this string
    '{insert your flag description}}'  -- replace this string
);
```

> Note, if you are using a flag or description containing more characters than you've defined/allowed in exercise 36, Snowflake will throw an error!

```sql
-- Step 3: Preview customers with negative balances
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    C_ACCTBAL
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
WHERE C_ACCTBAL < 0
ORDER BY C_ACCTBAL;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags`
* `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim`

#### How to think about it

This is a **classic anomaly flag** ‚Äî simple condition, but real business impact.

Start with:
- A clear and concise `status_flag` name (max 50 characters)
- A readable `status_description` (e.g. 100‚Äì200 characters)
Then:
- Use a basic `INSERT INTO ‚Ä¶ SELECT` to push those customer keys into the fact table

You don't need to store names or balances ‚Äî only the key and flag reference.

#### Step 1: Clean up previous flag version

```sql
DELETE FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim WHERE status_id = 2;
```

#### Step 2: Insert custom label for this anomaly

```sql
INSERT INTO WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim (
    status_id,
    status_flag,
    status_description
) VALUES (
    2,
    'neg_balance',
    'account shows negative balance, likely due to refund or data issue'
);
```

#### Step 3: Append negative-balance customers to audit flags

```sql
INSERT INTO WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags (C_CUSTKEY, STATUS_ID)
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    2 AS status_id
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
WHERE C_ACCTBAL < 0;
```

#### Step 4: Summarize enriched output

```sql
SELECT
    s.status_flag,
    s.status_description,
    COUNT(DISTINCT f.C_CUSTKEY) AS flagged_customers
FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags f
JOIN WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim s
  ON f.status_id = s.status_id
GROUP BY s.status_flag, s.status_description
ORDER BY flagged_customers DESC;
```

#### Why this works

You‚Äôve introduced a clean new audit rule without touching prior logic. Your fact table grows by appending ‚Äî your labels live in one place ‚Äî and you maintain full interpretability.

This pattern allows you to scale your audit framework by just adding new flags and targeting new anomalies.

#### Business answer

You‚Äôve flagged dozens of customers for negative balances and produced a clean audit summary showing all flagged categories so far.

#### Take-aways

* Use conditions (`WHERE`) to define anomaly types
* Separate flag labels from the data itself
* Always check and clean flags before re-running logic
* Good flag design communicates intent and value clearly

Modify your logic so that **only customers who are not already flagged with `status_id = 2`** are inserted.

This ensures your audit table doesn‚Äôt accumulate duplicate flags.

(Hint: use `WHERE NOT EXISTS` or `LEFT JOIN ‚Ä¶ IS NULL` against `customer_audit_flags`)
