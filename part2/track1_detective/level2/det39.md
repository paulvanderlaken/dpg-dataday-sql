## ex38: Inspect the Raw Audit Log Using Time Travel

> **Type:** Core | **Track:** SQL Detective  
>
> **Difficulty:** 7 / 10

### Business context
After implementing several audit rules ‚Äî including an override for VIP customers ‚Äî your team wants to assure **your ability to review how the audit trail evolved**.

You're asked to use **Snowflake's Time Travel** feature to:
- Look back at the audit table as it existed earlier
- Re-run the audit summary at that historical point
- Compare that to the current state

This simulates how real audit and data teams **trace the effect** of inserts and overrides over time.

Consult the following: [Snowflake docs ‚Äî AT | BEFORE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/at-before)

**Business logic & definitions:**
* `customer_audit_flags` holds all audit flag records
* `status_dim` explains what each `status_id` means
* You should have added a new audit flag for negative balances (`status_id = 2`) and VIPs (`status_id = 99`)
* Use `AT(TIMESTAMP => ‚Ä¶)` or `AT(OFFSET => ‚Ä¶)` to view the audit log before and after

---

### Starter queries

```sql
-- Step 1: Save the current timestamp BEFORE inserting new flags
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
-- üìù Copy this timestamp ‚Äî you can adjust it for usage
```

```sql
-- Step 2: Preview current raw audit records with full description
SELECT
    s.status_flag,
    s.status_description,
    COUNT(DISTINCT f.C_CUSTKEY) AS flagged_customers
FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags f
JOIN WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim s
  ON f.status_id = s.status_id
```

### Required datasets

* `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags`
* `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`

#### How to think about it

Use `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` *before* you run an `INSERT`. That gives you a safe checkpoint for `AT(TIMESTAMP => ‚Ä¶)`.

If you forgot to capture a timestamp, or can‚Äôt find the exact insert statement, use a **large OFFSET like -1000** ‚Äî this often rewinds far enough to give you the last "clean" version of the table.

If the raw rows aren‚Äôt different, your Time Travel isn‚Äôt far back enough.

#### Step 1: Save timestamp

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
-- Example: '2025-06-09 12:40:00'
```

#### Step 2: Current audit rows

```sql
SELECT
    f.C_CUSTKEY,
    c.C_NAME,
    s.status_flag,
    s.status_description,
    f.FLAGGED_AT
FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags f
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
  ON f.C_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim s
  ON f.status_id = s.status_id
ORDER BY f.C_CUSTKEY, f.status_id
LIMIT 20;
```

#### Step 3a: Audit rows before the insert (via timestamp)

```sql
SELECT
    f.C_CUSTKEY,
    c.C_NAME,
    s.status_flag,
    s.status_description,
    f.FLAGGED_AT
FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags AT(TIMESTAMP => '2025-06-09 12:40:00') f --replace with your relevant datetime
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
  ON f.C_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim s
  ON f.status_id = s.status_id
ORDER BY f.C_CUSTKEY, f.status_id
LIMIT 20;
```

#### Step 3b: Audit rows before the insert (via OFFSET)

```sql
SELECT
    f.C_CUSTKEY,
    c.C_NAME,
    s.status_flag,
    s.status_description,
    f.FLAGGED_AT
FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.customer_audit_flags AT(OFFSET => -1000) f --try to replace this with different offset
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
  ON f.C_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.status_dim s
  ON f.status_id = s.status_id
ORDER BY f.C_CUSTKEY, f.status_id
LIMIT 20;
```

#### Why this works

This technique lets you validate and trace **specific pipeline changes** ‚Äî without snapshot tables or manual backups. You can always look back at what changed, when, and why.

#### Business answer

The customers flagged for negative balances (`status_id = 2`) and those who got (re)flagged as VIPs (`status_id = 3`) are now clearly visible in the current audit log ‚Äî and absent in the version(s) that came before their insertion. You‚Äôve confirmed exactly what changed.
Going forward, you can now confidently demonstrate which customers were added by a specific rule, and when.

#### Take-aways

* Time Travel is a powerful way to validate and trace changes and record-level comparisons
* This pattern supports pipeline certification, rollback, and QA
* `AT(OFFSET => -N)` is a simple but powerful way to rewind history
* Consider adding `as_of_dt` with the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` to create a lineage

Can you think of a way in which to keep the original flags (like the negative balance) in the database, even for VIPs?
