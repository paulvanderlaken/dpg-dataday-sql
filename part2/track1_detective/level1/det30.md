## ex30: Identify Top 0.1% Revenue Orders

> **Type:** Core | **Track:** SQL Detective  
>
> **Difficulty:** 5 / 10

### Business context
As part of your audit pipeline, you're now asked to focus on the **orders** that contributed the most to company revenue. Finance leadership wants to isolate the **top 0.1%** of orders by **net revenue after discount**. These elite transactions may warrant special reporting, controls, or individual review.

Your task is to:
- Calculate total revenue per order
- Identify the **99.9th percentile** revenue cutoff
- Label all qualifying orders with a clear tag
- Store results in your audit schema

This final check will help close out the initial audit pass by highlighting the largest contributors to company revenue ‚Äî and ensuring none are overlooked for risk or reporting.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Net revenue per line item: `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`
* Total order revenue: sum of all line items per `L_ORDERKEY`
* Top 0.1% = any order **above the 99.9th percentile**
* Output: `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.top_orders_by_revenue`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview order-level revenue details
SELECT
    l.L_ORDERKEY,
    l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    l.L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

This is a **percentile-based outlier filter**.

Steps:
1. Aggregate revenue by order (`GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY`)
2. Use `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.999)` to compute the 99.9th percentile
3. Filter for orders exceeding that value
4. Add a literal column (e.g., `'top_0.1_percent'`) to label the flagged group
5. Store result in your audit schema

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WITH`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, `PERCENTILE_CONT`, `literal column`

```sql
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.999) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_net_revenue)
```

#### Working query

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate and store the top 0.1% orders by net revenue
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.top_orders_by_revenue AS
WITH order_revenue AS (
  SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_net_revenue
  FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
  GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY
),
cutoff AS (
  SELECT
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.999) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_net_revenue) AS threshold
  FROM order_revenue
)
SELECT
  o.L_ORDERKEY,
  o.total_net_revenue,
  'top_0.1_percent' AS revenue_flag
FROM order_revenue o, cutoff
WHERE o.total_net_revenue > cutoff.threshold;
```

```sql
-- Step 2: Review results
SELECT * FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.top_orders_by_revenue
ORDER BY total_net_revenue DESC;
```

#### Why this works

This query layers aggregation, statistical thresholding, and labeling to isolate **the most impactful orders**. It‚Äôs a classic data audit pattern: flag the tail of a distribution and track it separately.

#### Business answer

You‚Äôve identified the **top 0.1% of orders by revenue**. These transactions may reflect strategic accounts or high-value deals that warrant more attention from finance, risk, or leadership teams.

#### Take-aways

* Percentile-based filters help surface statistically extreme values
* Literal columns (`'top_0.1_percent'`) make downstream labeling consistent
* Persisting these segments enables future reconciliation or control processes
* This is a key step in pipeline-based risk scoring and revenue analysis

Create a second table, `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.bottom_orders_by_revenue`, with the **bottom 0.1% of orders** by revenue.

Then use a `UNION ALL` to combine the top and bottom extremes into a single table with a `revenue_flag` column:
- `'top_0.1_percent'`
- `'bottom_0.1_percent'`

This full-spectrum output will help stakeholders evaluate variance and investigate potential pricing leakage or missed opportunities.
