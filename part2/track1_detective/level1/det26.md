## ex26: Tag Parts Named After Suspicious Keywords

> **Type:** Core | **Track:** SQL Detective  
>
> **Difficulty:** 4 / 10

### Business context
With your audit workspace set up and your keyword list initialized, it‚Äôs time to run your first real check. The internal audit team has long suspected that parts in the product catalog may have been named using inconsistent or legacy conventions ‚Äî including food items and other unrelated terms.

You're asked to identify any parts whose names **match the suspicious tags** from your `tag_keywords` table and store them in a clean, labeled table for further review. This output will serve as your first **fact table** in the audit pipeline.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Matching logic: case-insensitive substring match between `P_NAME` and `tag_keywords.tag_label`
* Table design: output should include part key, name, and matching tag
* Storage: save as `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.flagged_parts_by_tag`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Explore some part names to see patterns
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`
* `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.tag_keywords`

#### How to think about it

This is a **semi-join pattern**: you‚Äôll check if each `P_NAME` contains any of the values listed in the `tag_keywords` table.

Use a `JOIN` where the condition is:
```sql
P_NAME ILIKE '%' || tag_keywords.tag_label || '%'
```

This allows dynamic, case-insensitive substring matching between the part names and your keywords.

Once your logic works, wrap the query in a `CREATE TABLE` statement to persist the results.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`ILIKE`, `JOIN ON`, dynamic matching, `CREATE TABLE AS`

```sql
-- Example pattern
JOIN tag_keywords k ON part.P_NAME ILIKE '%' || k.tag_label || '%'
```

#### Working query

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a new table with flagged part names
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.flagged_parts_by_tag AS
SELECT
    p.P_PARTKEY,
    p.P_NAME,
    k.tag_label AS matched_tag
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART p
JOIN WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.tag_keywords k
  ON p.P_NAME ILIKE '%' || k.tag_label || '%';
```

```sql
-- Step 2: Inspect your audit output
SELECT * FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.flagged_parts_by_tag
ORDER BY matched_tag, P_NAME;
```

#### Why this works

Instead of hardcoding terms, you dynamically joined the keyword list with the part catalog using a flexible `ILIKE` pattern. You then stored this tagged subset into a reusable audit table.

This simulates the first stage in a real data pipeline: **identifying and flagging records based on reference logic**, and saving the results for downstream checks.

#### Business answer

The audit reveals dozens of parts whose names contain suspicious keywords like `"almond"` and `"tomato"`. This confirms inconsistent naming conventions and justifies further review of catalog standards.

#### Take-aways

* Dynamic string matching using `ILIKE` + `JOIN` allows modular pattern tagging
* Avoid hardcoding logic ‚Äî reusable reference tables are more scalable
* Storing audit outputs in new tables simulates a fact table or staging layer
* This output can now be enriched, visualized, or used for compliance review

Add a new column to `flagged_parts_by_tag` that shows the **length of the part name** and another that flags any names over 40 characters as `"long_name" = TRUE`.

This simulates a **secondary audit rule** on naming conventions.
