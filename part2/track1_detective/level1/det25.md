## ex25: Create Your Audit Workspace + Tag Reference Table

> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
Before beginning your audit journey, you'll need a safe environment to work in. Since the TPch dataset is read-only, you'll create your **own database and schema** to stage flagged records, persist intermediate results, and simulate downstream processing.

To make this concrete, you'll also create your first helper table: a reference list of **suspicious keywords** ‚Äî in this case, food-related terms ‚Äî that may indicate inconsistency or legacy naming patterns in the product catalog.

This small setup task will power future audit steps.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Your working schema: `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA`
* Audit helper table: `tag_keywords`
* Food-related terms of interest: `'almond'`, `'tomato'`, `'chocolate'`, `'vanilla'`, `'peach'`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview your current context (should not be SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA)
SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA();
```

### Required datasets

* Your own schema: `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA`
* Manually created helper table: `tag_keywords`

#### How to think about it

You're creating a **personal staging environment**. In Snowflake, session context (like `USE DATABASE`) only takes effect *after* you run it ‚Äî so you **must run each step one at a time**, in order.

**Steps:**
1. Run the `CREATE DATABASE` first ‚Äî this makes the top-level workspace.
2. Then create the `SCHEMA`.
3. After that, use both `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` to activate your context.
4. Now you're ready to create your first table.
5. Insert values into it.
6. Finally, query it.

Don't run them all together ‚Äî Snowflake will throw errors if you try to insert before context is properly set.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE SCHEMA`, `USE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`

```sql
-- Example reference table
CREATE TABLE my_schema.my_table (term STRING);
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES ('apple'), ('banana');
```

#### Step-by-step: Run each block individually

```sql
-- Step 1: Create your database
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE WORKSHOP_DB;
```

```sql
-- Step 2: Create your schema
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA;
```

```sql
-- Step 3: Set your session context
USE DATABASE WORKSHOP_DB;
USE SCHEMA TEMP_SCHEMA;
```

```sql
-- Step 4: Create the reference tag table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE tag_keywords (
    tag_label STRING
);
```

```sql
-- Step 5: Insert suspicious terms
INSERT INTO tag_keywords (tag_label)
VALUES 
    ('almond'),
    ('tomato'),
    ('chocolate'),
    ('vanilla'),
    ('peach');
```

```sql
-- Step 6: Preview your helper table
SELECT * FROM tag_keywords;
```

#### Why this works

Snowflake requires that `USE DATABASE` and `USE SCHEMA` be executed *before* you attempt to create or query unqualified tables. Running everything at once can result in "table not found" or context-related errors.

You've now established your own working environment and created your first reusable reference table for audit logic.

#### Business answer

You‚Äôve successfully initialized an audit environment and seeded a helper table to flag suspicious naming conventions. This enables modular and scalable audit workflows going forward.

#### Take-aways

* Always separate **source** data (e.g. TPCH) from **audit/output** layers
* Run `USE` commands *before* trying to query or create unqualified tables
* Helper tables simplify logic and make your SQL more maintainable and extensible
* Running complex logic as **isolated steps** avoids cascading errors

<summary>üéÅ Bonus Exercise (click to expand)</summary>

Add a second column to `tag_keywords` to indicate the **category** of each term. For example, mark all current tags as `"food"`, but imagine in the future you might also want to flag `"color"` or `"material"` tags too.

Update your table to include this structure and reload the values accordingly.
