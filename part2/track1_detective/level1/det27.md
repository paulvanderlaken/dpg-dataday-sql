## ex27: Identify Customers with No Orders

> **Type:** Core | **Track:** SQL Detective

> **Difficulty:** 3 / 10

### Business context
As part of your audit initiative, the operations lead has asked for a review of **customer activity records**. There are concerns that some accounts were imported from legacy systems but never became active ‚Äî possibly due to onboarding issues or incomplete migrations.

Your task is to identify all customers who **have never placed a single order** ‚Äî and store them in a separate table for further investigation by the customer success team.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Inactive customer: a record in `CUSTOMER` that has **no matching orders** in `ORDERS`
* Matching logic: link on `C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY`
* Output: store results in `WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.inactive_customers`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview the customer table
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    C_MKTSEGMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`

#### How to think about it

You're detecting **orphaned records**: customers that exist in the system but never made a transaction.

Use a `LEFT JOIN` from `CUSTOMER` to `ORDERS` to retain all customers. Then apply a filter:  
```sql
WHERE O_ORDERKEY IS NULL
```

This is called an **anti-join**, and it's one of the most reliable ways to catch ‚Äúmissing‚Äù relationships.

Once you're confident the logic works, wrap it inside a `CREATE TABLE AS` to persist it for later audits.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`LEFT JOIN`, `IS NULL`, `CREATE TABLE AS`

```sql
-- Anti-join pattern
SELECT ‚Ä¶
FROM A
LEFT JOIN B ON A.key = B.key
WHERE B.key IS NULL;
```

#### Working query

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a table of inactive customers
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.inactive_customers AS
SELECT
    c.C_CUSTKEY,
    c.C_NAME,
    c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    c.C_ACCTBAL
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
LEFT JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
  ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
WHERE o.O_ORDERKEY IS NULL;
```

```sql
-- Step 2: View your audit result
SELECT * FROM WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.inactive_customers
ORDER BY C_CUSTKEY;
```

#### Why this works

The `LEFT JOIN` ensures all customers are kept, even if they didn‚Äôt place any orders. Filtering on `O_ORDERKEY IS NULL` isolates those with no match.

You‚Äôve also saved this to your audit schema, so this list can be handed off to the customer success team for follow-up actions.

#### Business answer

There are hundreds of customer records that never placed an order ‚Äî potentially abandoned signups or incomplete data migrations.

#### Take-aways

* Anti-joins (`LEFT JOIN ‚Ä¶ IS NULL`) are essential tools for data integrity audits
* These patterns scale well to many-to-many and complex multi-table joins
* Persisting orphaned records in dedicated tables allows downstream remediation
* Every pipeline or data model needs tests for ‚Äúpresence of expected links‚Äù

Group the inactive customers by `C_MKTSEGMENT` and count how many appear in each. Store this as a summary table:  
`WORKSHOP_DB.TEMP_SCHEMA.inactive_customer_counts_by_segment`

This will support visualizations or alerts by segment type.
