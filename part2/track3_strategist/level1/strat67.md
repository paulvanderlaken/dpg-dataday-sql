## ex67: Yearly Order Coverage and Summary Stats

> **Type:** Core | **Track:** Business Strategist  
>
> **Difficulty:** 3 / 10

### Business context
You‚Äôve just been asked to support a strategic revenue deep dive for the finance team. 
Before doing any calculations, you want to grasp which **years have complete order data** ‚Äî and how the business performed in those years. 
Hence, your task is three-fold:
1. **Group the orders by year** and show the **date range** of activity per year.
2. Include key **summary statistics** per year: total gross revenue, total discounts, and taxes.
3. Visualize gross and net revenue in a line chart using Snowflake's built-in functionality.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* order year = `YEAR(O_ORDERDATE)`
* net revenue = `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`
* total discount = `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT`
* total tax = `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_TAX`
* order = defined in `ORDERS`; revenue from matching rows in `LINEITEM`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview the orders and line items to understand date and pricing structure
SELECT
    O_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    L_TAX
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM L
  ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

Start by joining orders and line items to get both the order date and pricing information. Use `YEAR()` to group by order year. Then compute:
- the **min and max** order date (per year),
- the **total extended price** (gross revenue),
- the **total discount** and **total tax** using calculated expressions.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`YEAR()`, `GROUP BY`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, arithmetic expressions

```sql
SELECT
  YEAR(order_date),
  SUM(price),
  SUM(price * discount)
FROM ‚Ä¶
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date);
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    YEAR(O.O_ORDERDATE) AS order_year,
    MIN(O.O_ORDERDATE) AS first_order_date,
    MAX(O.O_ORDERDATE) AS last_order_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) AS num_orders,
    SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS gross_revenue,
    SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L.L_DISCOUNT) AS total_discount,
    SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L.L_TAX) AS total_tax,
    SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L.L_DISCOUNT)) AS net_revenue
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM L
  ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY
GROUP BY YEAR(O.O_ORDERDATE)
ORDER BY order_year;
```

#### Why this works

This query joins orders with their line items to access both order date and pricing components. It groups the data by year and then aggregates key metrics: the time coverage and the financial performance.

Your Snowflake chart could look as follows:

#### Business answer

The year **1997** is the most recent full year of data, with complete coverage from January to December. It also has the highest gross and net revenue ‚Äî making it the best candidate for deeper revenue analysis.

#### Take-aways

* Combine `MIN()`/`MAX()` with `YEAR()` to validate dataset completeness.
* Use simple expressions to break down pricing components like tax and discount.
* A well-structured `GROUP BY` can deliver both time audit and financial summary.
* Don't overlook basic temporal checks before diving into KPIs or trends.

Add **average net revenue per order** to your query. Use `SUM(net_revenue) / COUNT(DISTINCT O_ORDERKEY)` or a CTE to cleanly separate steps.

Can you make a barchart in Snowflake, showing how the revenue per order changed over the years?
