## ex01: Top 10 Customers by Balance

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
The loyalty team wants to surprise our 10 biggest spenders with a bespoke gift box. Before we finalise the budget, we need to know which 10 customers currently hold the highest account balances. Identifying these key clients helps us prioritise who gets included in the premium tier of the loyalty program.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Account balance: stored in `CUSTOMER.C_ACCTBAL`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview customer balance data
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`

#### How to think about it

You‚Äôre being asked to find the top 10 customers by account balance. Start by identifying which column represents that balance. Then sort the data in descending order to put the highest balances first. Use `LIMIT` to return only the top 10 rows.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name
ORDER BY column2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    C_ACCTBAL
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
ORDER BY C_ACCTBAL DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Why this works

We sort the customers by `C_ACCTBAL` in descending order to put the highest balances on top, then use `LIMIT 10` to keep just the top 10 records. This is a common pattern for top-N analysis and performs efficiently on indexed or sorted datasets.

#### Business answer

These 10 customers have the highest account balances and should be prioritised for loyalty outreach.

#### Take-aways

* You practiced sorting results with `ORDER BY` and narrowing focus using `LIMIT`
* You saw how to combine basic clauses to answer ranked list-style questions
* You learned to identify key value columns for business-style ranking
* Top-N queries are foundational ‚Äî they appear across analytics, dashboards, and diagnostics

<summary>üéÅ Bonus Exercise (click to expand)</summary>

Instead of just returning the top 10, calculate the **average account balance per market segment**, and highlight which segments have the highest average balances.

This requires:
- Grouping by `C_MKTSEGMENT`
- Using `AVG(C_ACCTBAL)`
- Ordering by that average in descending order

Are there any segments with especially high-value customers?
