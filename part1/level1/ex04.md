## ex04: Count Customers by Segment

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
Marketing leadership is evaluating how customer distribution varies across business segments. To help inform segment-specific initiatives, they‚Äôve asked for a quick overview of how many customers are active in each market segment in our database. This will support decisions around campaign targeting and budget allocation.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* market segment: defined in `C_MKTSEGMENT` on the `CUSTOMER` table
* customer count per segment: number of unique customers grouped by market segment

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview customer segment data
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    C_MKTSEGMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`

#### How to think about it

To get segment-level customer counts, group the customer data by the `C_MKTSEGMENT` column and count the number of customers in each group. Use the `GROUP BY` clause on the market segment, and `COUNT(*)` to calculate how many customers belong to each.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY`, `COUNT(*)`

```sql
SELECT column, COUNT(*) 
FROM table 
GROUP BY column;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C_MKTSEGMENT,
    COUNT(*) AS CUSTOMER_COUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
GROUP BY C_MKTSEGMENT
ORDER BY CUSTOMER_COUNT DESC;
```

#### Why this works

This query groups all customers by their market segment using `GROUP BY C_MKTSEGMENT` and then counts how many customers are in each group using `COUNT(*)`. The `ORDER BY` clause ranks segments from most to least populated, making it easier to interpret.

#### Business answer

The MARKET segment has the highest number of customers, followed by segments such as AUTOMOBILE and HOUSEHOLD.

#### Take-aways

* You‚Äôve learned how to use `GROUP BY` to aggregate values in a column
* You‚Äôve practiced combining `GROUP BY` with `COUNT()` for summarizing categories
* `GROUP BY` always requires you to either aggregate or include the grouped column in the SELECT
* Sorting by count (using `ORDER BY`) can make the output easier to digest, especially for reporting

Add a second level of grouping to show how many customers exist per segment **and** per nation. You‚Äôll need to join the `CUSTOMER` and `NATION` tables using `C_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY`, and then group by both `C_MKTSEGMENT` and `N_NAME`.

Can you identify any segments that are especially concentrated in certain nations?
