## ex06: Compare Table Sizes ‚Äì Parts vs Suppliers

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
The data engineering team is preparing for a data warehousing initiative. As a quick feasibility check, they want to compare how many rows exist in the `PART` and `SUPPLIER` tables to understand scale differences between product and supplier data.

A compact comparison table will help communicate this to stakeholders.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Previewing rows in each table
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
LIMIT 10;

SELECT S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`

#### How to think about it

This task introduces a new kind of output: combining single-row results. It‚Äôs not harder, just structurally different.

To compare row counts side-by-side, you‚Äôll want to run one `SELECT COUNT(*)` for each table ‚Äî but Snowflake will only return one result at a time unless you combine them.

To do that:
- Label each result using a **string literal** like `'PART'` or `'SUPPLIER'`
- Use the `AS` keyword to name each column (`AS table_name`, `AS row_count`)
- Use `UNION ALL` to combine the two results into one output

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`COUNT(*)`, `UNION ALL`, `AS`, string literals

```sql
-- General structure (not the final query!)
SELECT 'Something' AS label, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM some_table
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Other', COUNT(*) FROM another_table;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT 'PART' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SUPPLIER' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER;
```

#### Why this works

Each `SELECT` returns a single row with a labeled count. The `AS` keyword creates clear column headers: `'PART'` becomes `table_name`, and the count becomes `row_count`. `UNION ALL` stacks the two single-row results vertically so we can easily compare them in one result.

#### Business answer

There are significantly more parts than suppliers ‚Äî which reflects the many-to-one nature of the part-to-supplier relationship in the business.

#### Take-aways

* `COUNT(*)` is a simple way to understand table size
* You can combine small result sets using `UNION ALL`
* `AS` lets you rename outputs ‚Äî this is especially useful for **string labels**, **calculated fields**, and **presentation**
* Quoted strings (like `'PART'`) can be used as values in `SELECT` to label rows

<summary>üéÅ Bonus Exercise (click to expand)</summary>

Try comparing **how many unique suppliers** are listed in the `PARTSUPP` table. Is the number the same as in the `SUPPLIER` table?

This helps detect whether all suppliers are actively linked to parts.
