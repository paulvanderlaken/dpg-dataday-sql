> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 1 / 10

### Business context
The marketing team is preparing a targeted campaign for businesses in the building industry. They believe this segment holds untapped potential for upselling premium services. To begin, they need a clean list of customers currently operating in the "BUILDING" market segment.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Market segment: stored in `CUSTOMER.C_MKTSEGMENT`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Inspecting the customer dataset to understand available fields
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`

#### How to think about it

You‚Äôll want to isolate rows where the customer's market segment matches a specific string. Make sure your condition is case-sensitive if needed. Focus only on the rows that are relevant for this campaign by applying a `WHERE` filter to the market segment column.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WHERE`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column3 = 'SomeValue';
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    C_MKTSEGMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
WHERE C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING';
```

#### Why this works

This query filters the `CUSTOMER` table to return only those records where the market segment (`C_MKTSEGMENT`) equals `'BUILDING'`. It's a straightforward use of the `WHERE` clause for categorical filtering.

#### Business answer

The result is a filtered list of customers that belong to the BUILDING segment ‚Äî ready for further segmentation or outreach.

#### Take-aways

* You learned to filter rows based on a specific category using `WHERE`
* You practiced identifying and querying a meaningful business segment
* Filtering is one of the most common operations in SQL ‚Äî this is a core fluency step
* String comparisons may be case-sensitive in SQL ‚Äî always confirm when exact matching is required

Now go one step further and find out **how many BUILDING segment customers exist per nation**.

To do this:
- Join the `CUSTOMER` table to the `NATION` table on `C_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY`
- Filter for `'BUILDING'` segment
- Group by `N_NAME` and count customers per country

This shows how filters and grouping logic can combine for more granular insight.
