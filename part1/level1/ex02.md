> **Difficulty:** 1 / 10

### Business context
The marketing team is preparing a targeted campaign for businesses in the building industry. They believe this segment holds untapped potential for upselling premium services. To begin, they need a clean list of customers currently operating in the "BUILDING" market segment.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Inspecting the customer dataset to understand available fields
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`

#### How to think about it

Youâ€™ll want to isolate rows where the customer's market segment matches a specific string. Make sure your condition is case-sensitive if needed. Focus only on the rows that are relevant for this campaign by applying a `WHERE` filter to the market segment column.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WHERE`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column3 = 'SomeValue';
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    C_MKTSEGMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
WHERE C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING';
```

#### Why this works

This query filters the `CUSTOMER` table to return only those records where the market segment (`C_MKTSEGMENT`) equals "BUILDING". It's a simple use of the `WHERE` clause for equality filteringâ€”ideal for early campaign targeting tasks.

#### Business answer

The output is a list of customers in the BUILDING segment, suitable for marketing outreach.

#### Take-aways

* Learn how to filter records based on exact matches using `WHERE`.
* Always check for case sensitivity when working with string comparisons.
* Filtering early helps reduce the data you're working with downstream.
