## ex10: Compute Price with Tax and Discount

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
Finance is modeling gross-to-net revenue transitions as part of a new tax compliance analysis. To get an initial sense of scale, they want to see the full price breakdown per line item: the raw extended price, the post-discount value, and a hypothetical 15% tax applied on top of the raw price. This will allow them to separate the effects of discounts and tax on overall revenue, and serve as input to their revenue forecasting model.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Net price after discount: `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`
* Tax-inclusive price (15%): `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * 1.15`
* Note: tax is applied to list price, not discounted price

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview key price components to be modeled
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_SUPPKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

This is our first example of parallel modeling ‚Äî treating the same column in different calculations.

Break the calculation into two parts:
- First, compute the net revenue after applying the discount. The discount is given as a decimal (e.g., 0.04 = 4%), so subtract it from 1 and multiply it by the base price.
- Then separately compute the taxed amount as 15% on the original base price ‚Äî this simulation assumes the tax is applied on list prices before any discount.

Return all three: original price, discounted price, and taxed price.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`Arithmetic in SELECT`, `Aliasing`

```sql
SELECT column, column * (1 - discount), column * 1.15 FROM ‚Ä¶;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_SUPPKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE AS ORIGINAL_PRICE,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS PRICE_AFTER_DISCOUNT,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE * 1.15 AS PRICE_WITH_TAX
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM;
```

#### Why this works

This query outputs three columns:
- The original price (`L_EXTENDEDPRICE`),
- The price after applying the discount (`L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`),
- The price if a 15% tax were applied to the original price (`L_EXTENDEDPRICE * 1.15`).

By keeping these separate, it‚Äôs easy to see how tax and discount independently affect pricing models.

#### Business answer

This provides a breakdown of pricing before and after discount, and simulates a tax-inclusive price ‚Äî useful for revenue model inputs and comparative pricing scenarios.

#### Take-aways

* Learn how to apply arithmetic operations directly in a `SELECT` clause
* Understand how to separate multiple derived calculations in one query
* Build confidence working with decimal percentages and chained expressions
* See how SQL can model parallel scenarios with very minimal code

Extend the query to calculate a **final customer-facing price** by combining both discount and tax effects.  
Use the formula:

```sql
final_price = (L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) * 1.15
```

Then:
- Add this as a fourth derived column (aliased as `FINAL_PRICE`)
- Compare how it differs from the pre-discount taxed version

This encourages careful order-of-operations reasoning in financial-style computations.
