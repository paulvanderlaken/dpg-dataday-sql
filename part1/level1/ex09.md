## ex09: Suppliers with Missing Comments

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 1 / 10

### Business context
A new supplier onboarding audit suggested that some entries might be incomplete. In particular, the team suspects that several supplier records are missing commentary or notes. These notes are critical for documentation. The data team has been asked to identify which supplier profiles lack this information so that the onboarding process can be reviewed.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Missing commentary: when `S_COMMENT` is `NULL`
* Audit target: supplier records without values in the comment field

### Starter query
```sql
-- Previewing supplier data
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`

#### How to think about it

Use the `IS NULL` keyword to find rows where a value is missing. Don‚Äôt confuse this with empty strings (`''`) ‚Äî SQL treats nulls differently. You're specifically looking for entries that haven‚Äôt been filled in at all.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`IS NULL`

```sql
SELECT ‚Ä¶
FROM ‚Ä¶
WHERE column IS NULL;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    S_SUPPKEY,
    S_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER
WHERE S_COMMENT IS NULL;
```

> Note: This query returns **zero results**, which confirms that all supplier comments are filled.


#### Why this works

`IS NULL` is the correct operator for detecting truly missing values. It doesn‚Äôt match empty strings or whitespace ‚Äî only absent entries. In this case, the audit query confirms that all supplier comments are populated.

#### Business answer

This query produces no results. This implies that all suppliers have values for `S_COMMENT` that are non-`NULL`. The teams' suspicions were ungrounded.

#### Take-aways

* Learn how to detect truly missing values in SQL using `IS NULL`
* Understand the difference between `NULL` and an empty string
* Build familiarity with data quality checks using basic SQL filters
* Realize that a valid result can still be an empty table ‚Äî and that can be a good thing

Instead of only checking for `NULL`, extend the logic to also flag **blank or whitespace-only comments**.  
Use this condition in your `WHERE` clause:

```sql
WHERE TRIM(S_COMMENT) = '' OR S_COMMENT IS NULL
```

This will help you identify records that technically exist ‚Äî but provide no useful content. A valuable step in real-world audits.
