## ex09: Suppliers with Missing Comments

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 1 / 10

### Business context
A new supplier onboarding audit suggested that some entries are incomplete. In particular, the team suspects that several supplier records do not contain commentary or notes. These notes are essential for procurement history and contract context. The data team has been asked to identify which supplier profiles are missing this information so the onboarding team can follow up.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Previewing supplier data
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`

#### How to think about it

Look for missing entries in the `S_COMMENT` column. SQL provides special syntax to handle `NULL` valuesâ€”these are not equal to empty strings or other values. Use a condition that checks for null explicitly rather than using standard comparisons.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`IS NULL`

```sql
SELECT â€¦ FROM â€¦ WHERE column IS NULL;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    S_SUPPKEY,
    S_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER
WHERE S_COMMENT IS NULL;
```

> Note: This query should produce no results.

#### Why this works

The query filters the `SUPPLIER` table to return only those rows where `S_COMMENT` has no value (`IS NULL`). This allows us to identify suppliers with incomplete onboarding information. The use of `IS NULL` is critical because nulls do not behave like other values in conditional logic.

#### Business answer

This query produces no results. This implies that all suppliers have values for `S_COMMENT` that are non-`NULL`. The teams' suspicions were ungrounded.

#### Take-aways

* `IS NULL` is the correct way to detect missing values in SQL.
* Empty strings (`''`) and `NULL` are not the same.
* Audits for data completeness often rely on null detection logic.
