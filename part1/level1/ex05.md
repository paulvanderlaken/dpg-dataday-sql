## ex05: High-Quantity or Low-Price Lineitems

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
The sales operations team is evaluating candidates for a new bulk discount and price review program. Their goal is to flag line items that suggest either very large order volumes or unusually low total prices ‚Äî both potential indicators of wholesale activity or margin erosion.

Based on recent sales data:
- **Orders of 50 units or more** represent the **top ~1%** of quantity volumes,
- **Line items under $1,000** fall within the **bottom ~1%** of total value.

These thresholds will guide which transactions warrant review for new discount tiers or pricing exceptions.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* High-quantity line: `L_QUANTITY >= 50`
* Low-price line: `L_EXTENDEDPRICE < 1000`
* Include records that match **either** condition

### Starter query
```sql
-- Explore line item quantities and extended prices
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

You're asked to return line items that satisfy either of two business rules. Use the `OR` operator in your `WHERE` clause to include both cases. These conditions are grounded in the dataset's real distribution‚Äîtry to reason from the data rather than guess.

Also be careful with `OR` versus `AND`, and remember to use parentheses when combining conditions in more complex filters.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WHERE`, `OR`

```sql
SELECT ‚Ä¶ FROM ‚Ä¶ WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_QUANTITY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
WHERE L_QUANTITY >= 50
   OR L_EXTENDEDPRICE < 1000;
```

#### Why this works

This query retrieves line items that meet either the high-quantity (‚â• 50 units) or low-price (< $1,000) thresholds, based on quantiles in the actual data:
- `L_QUANTITY >= 50` flags the top ~1% of volume,
- `L_EXTENDEDPRICE < 1000` catches the lowest ~1% of price values.

Using `OR` ensures that if either condition is true, the record is included.

#### Business answer

A total set of extreme-value line items was identified ‚Äî either due to very high volume or very low price ‚Äî suitable for closer inspection.

#### Take-aways

* Practice using compound conditions and understanding the difference between `AND` and `OR`
* Learn how to structure queries that use thresholds grounded in real data
* Understand that logical filters are critical to building relevant subsets
* Use parentheses for clarity when filters get more complex

Extend the query to **count** how many high-volume and low-price items appear in the dataset, and compute their **average discount**.

Use:

- `COUNT(*)` to get total flagged line items
- `AVG(L_DISCOUNT)` to understand whether these items are more likely to be discounted

You can wrap the original filter logic in a subquery or CTE if needed.
