## ex08: Count Orders Containing Almond Products

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
We‚Äôve seen how part names can carry meaning ‚Äî the next challenge becomes exploring how often a specific product type has appeared in orders.

Coincidentally the marketing team is preparing a special promotion for almond-themed products. As a first step, they want to understand **how often almond products have been ordered** ‚Äî a basic signal of past demand.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* almond products: parts where `P_NAME` contains the substring "almond"
* product orders: tracked in `LINEITEM`, via `L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY`
* distinct orders: the number of **unique** order keys 

### Starter query
```sql
SELECT P_PARTKEY, P_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

You need to:
1. Identify all `PART`s where the name contains ‚Äúalmond‚Äù (case-insensitive match)
2. Join to `LINEITEM` to see which orders included those parts
3. Count how many **distinct orders** that represents

You can use `COUNT(DISTINCT ‚Ä¶)` to avoid double-counting the same order if it included multiple almond items.

> The link between products and orders is `LINEITEM.L_PARTKEY` = `PART.P_PARTKEY`.


#### Helpful SQL concepts

`ILIKE`, `JOIN`, `COUNT(DISTINCT ‚Ä¶)`

```sql
-- General logic
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)
FROM part
JOIN lineitem ON part.key = lineitem.key
WHERE part.name ILIKE '%almond%';
```

#### üí° Tip: `LIKE` vs `ILIKE`

Snowflake‚Äôs `LIKE` is case-sensitive ‚Äî it won‚Äôt match `'Almond'` if you search for `'almond'`.  
Use `ILIKE` to make your search case-insensitive.

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT L.L_ORDERKEY) AS almond_order_count
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART P
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM L
  ON P.P_PARTKEY = L.L_PARTKEY
WHERE P.P_NAME ILIKE '%almond%';
```

#### Why this works

This query finds all line items tied to almond parts, then counts the number of **unique order keys** across those items ‚Äî giving us a de-duplicated count of how many orders involved almond products.

#### Business answer

There are a number of distinct past orders involving almond-themed products ‚Äî supporting the idea that there‚Äôs pre-existing customer interest.

#### Take-aways

* `ILIKE` allows case-insensitive filtering for substrings
* Use `ILIKE` when you want to match patterns regardless of upper/lowercase ‚Äî unlike `LIKE`, which is case-sensitive
* `COUNT(DISTINCT ‚Ä¶)` is key when counting unique entities across multiple rows

Instead of counting orders, try listing the **top 5 almond-related parts** by number of line items.

Hint: group by `P_NAME`, then use `COUNT(*)`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.
