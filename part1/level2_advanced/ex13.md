## ex13: Orders per Customer in 1995

> **Type:** Core  
> **Difficulty:** 4 / 10

### Business context
The sales team wants a breakdown of customer activity during 1995 to evaluate how different customer segments behaved that year. Theyâ€™re particularly interested in seeing which customers placed orders, when they did so, and from which nations these customers originated. This will support their planning for territory-specific outreach and customer retention efforts.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Inspect order records with customer and order dates
SELECT
    O_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_CUSTKEY
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION`

#### How to think about it

Youâ€™ll need to join `ORDERS` to `CUSTOMER` to get customer names and segments, and then link `CUSTOMER` to `NATION` using the foreign key `C_NATIONKEY`. Use a `WHERE` clause to filter for orders placed in 1995 using the `O_ORDERDATE` column.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`, `DATE` filtering

```sql
SELECT â€¦
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.key = table2.key
WHERE date_column BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-12-31';
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C.C_NAME,
    N.N_NAME AS nation,
    O.O_ORDERDATE,
    O.O_ORDERKEY
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
    ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION N
    ON C.C_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY
WHERE O.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-12-31';
```

#### Why this works

The query connects orders with their customers and then links each customer to their corresponding nation. The `WHERE` clause restricts results to only orders placed in 1995. This gives a clear view of customer-level order activity across countries within the specified time frame.

#### Business answer

You now have a full list of 1995 customer orders, including customer name and nation â€” ideal for analyzing regional trends and customer behavior that year.

#### Take-aways

* Use `INNER JOIN` to combine data across related tables.
* `WHERE` filters rows **before aggregation**, ideal for limiting data early.
* Always match foreign keys (`*_KEY`) correctly to avoid cartesian joins or broken filters.
