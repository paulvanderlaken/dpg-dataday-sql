## ex15: Customers with Recency and Order Count

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
The customer relationship team is preparing a tiered engagement strategy. To make informed decisions, they want to understand not only how many orders each customer has placed, but also how recently they placed them. Customers with many orders but no recent activity may need re-engagement, while those with recent purchases are prime for upselling. Can you provide a list of customers with both their most recent order date and total order count?

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview customers and their related orders
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    O_ORDERDATE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
    ON C.C_CUSTKEY = O.O_CUSTKEY
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`

#### How to think about it

Youâ€™ll need to compute two different metrics per customer: their latest order date (recency) and how many orders theyâ€™ve placed (volume). This requires aggregation, but youâ€™ll also want to include the customer name from the base `CUSTOMER` table. Use a subquery to compute the aggregated values grouped by customer, and then join that back to the `CUSTOMER` table.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY, MAX, COUNT, JOIN, subquery in FROM`

```sql
SELECT â€¦
FROM (
  SELECT O_CUSTKEY, MAX(O_ORDERDATE), COUNT(*) â€¦
  FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
  GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
) â€¦
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER â€¦
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C.C_NAME,
    C.C_CUSTKEY,
    OINFO.RECENT_ORDER_DATE,
    OINFO.ORDER_COUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT
        O_CUSTKEY,
        MAX(O_ORDERDATE) AS RECENT_ORDER_DATE,
        COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
    GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
) OINFO
    ON C.C_CUSTKEY = OINFO.O_CUSTKEY
ORDER BY OINFO.RECENT_ORDER_DATE DESC;
```

#### Why this works

The subquery calculates both the latest order date and number of orders per customer. Joining it back to the `CUSTOMER` table ensures we retrieve human-readable customer information. Sorting by recency lets the business team quickly see which customers are most active.

#### Business answer

You now have a list of all customers along with how recently and how often theyâ€™ve orderedâ€”ideal for segmentation and engagement planning.

#### Take-aways

* This exercise demonstrates how to calculate *recency* and *frequency*, two key metrics in customer analytics.
* Subqueries in the `FROM` clause can help separate complex logic cleanly from presentation logic.
* Always double-check join keys and cardinality: `CUSTOMER` is 1-to-many with `ORDERS`.
* Consider indexing or partitioning by customer ID for large-scale versions of this query to maintain performance.
