## ex17: Supplier-Part List with Cost Flag

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
The procurement team wants to reassess supplier contracts by identifying where supply costs are unusually high. Specifically, they need a listing of all parts and their associated suppliers, with a flag indicating whether the supplier's cost for that part is above the average cost for that part across all suppliers. This will help initiate renegotiations or replacements where margins are being squeezed.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Average supply cost per part: the average of `PS_SUPPLYCOST` grouped by `PS_PARTKEY`
* Above-average flag: 1 if `PS_SUPPLYCOST > AVG(PS_SUPPLYCOST)`, else 0

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview supplier-part relationships and their supply cost
SELECT
    PS_PARTKEY,
    PS_SUPPKEY,
    PS_SUPPLYCOST
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PARTSUPP
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PARTSUPP`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`

### Bonus Exercise
Include the part name (`P_NAME`) and supplier name (`S_NAME`) in your result, and sort the output to show the above-average suppliers first within each part group.

#### How to think about it

Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to compute the average supply cost per part. Then, join this result back to the main `PARTSUPP` table to compare each supplier's cost with the part average. Add a conditional expression to create the cost flag.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WITH`, `JOIN`, `AVG()`, `CASE WHEN`

```sql
-- Pattern: join against per-group average
WITH avg_table AS (
  SELECT key, AVG(value) AS avg_val
  FROM â€¦
  GROUP BY key
)
SELECT â€¦
FROM main_table
JOIN avg_table USING (key)
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH avg_cost_per_part AS (
    SELECT
        PS_PARTKEY,
        AVG(PS_SUPPLYCOST) AS AVG_COST
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PARTSUPP
    GROUP BY PS_PARTKEY
)

SELECT
    ps.PS_PARTKEY,
    p.P_NAME,
    ps.PS_SUPPKEY,
    s.S_NAME,
    ps.PS_SUPPLYCOST,
    CASE
        WHEN ps.PS_SUPPLYCOST > avg.AVG_COST THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END AS ABOVE_AVG_COST
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PARTSUPP ps
JOIN avg_cost_per_part avg
    ON ps.PS_PARTKEY = avg.PS_PARTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART p
    ON ps.PS_PARTKEY = p.P_PARTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s
    ON ps.PS_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
ORDER BY ps.PS_PARTKEY, ABOVE_AVG_COST DESC;
```

#### Why this works

The CTE computes the average cost per part key. By joining this CTE back to the main `PARTSUPP` table, we can compare individual supplier costs against the group average. A simple `CASE` expression flags those exceeding the benchmark. The joins enrich the output with names, and sorting helps procurement focus attention on potential overcharges.

#### Business answer

This query highlights all supplier-part combinations and flags suppliers that charge above the partâ€™s average cost.

#### Take-aways

* You learned how to compute and reuse aggregate values using a CTE.
* You applied conditional logic using `CASE WHEN` to flag entries.
* A common mistake is to forget grouping by `PS_PARTKEY` in the CTE â€” this leads to computing a global average instead.
* Using CTEs to compute per-group metrics helps modularize and clarify complex logic without nesting subqueries.
