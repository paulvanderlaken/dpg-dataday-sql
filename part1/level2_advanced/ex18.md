## ex18: Rewrite Scalar Subquery to Count Lineitems per Order

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
The fulfillment analytics team is reviewing order complexity to help optimize packaging and shipping. They‚Äôve requested an overview showing how many items were included in each order. An analyst wrote a query using a scalar subquery to count line items per order ‚Äî but this approach may cause performance issues as data volumes grow. Your task is to rewrite it using a more efficient strategy.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* order ‚Üí line item relationship: defined via foreign key `L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY`
* item count per order: number of line items associated with each order


### Starter query
```sql
-- Inefficient: executes a subquery for every order row
SELECT
    O_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
        WHERE l.L_ORDERKEY = o.O_ORDERKEY
    ) AS ITEM_COUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

Instead of counting line items one order at a time, join the `ORDERS` and `LINEITEM` tables and group the results by order. This allows Snowflake to process all rows in bulk rather than through repeated subqueries.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `COUNT(*)`

```sql
SELECT col, COUNT(*) FROM table JOIN ‚Ä¶ GROUP BY col;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    o.O_ORDERKEY,
    o.O_ORDERDATE,
    COUNT(l.L_LINENUMBER) AS ITEM_COUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
    ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
GROUP BY o.O_ORDERKEY, o.O_ORDERDATE;
```

#### Why this works

The rewritten query performs a single join between `ORDERS` and `LINEITEM` and groups the results to count items per order. This eliminates the need to scan `LINEITEM` repeatedly ‚Äî improving performance significantly, especially as `LINEITEM` grows into the millions of rows in production.

#### Business answer

Each order now has a computed count of how many items were shipped ‚Äî e.g., Order 1005 had 3 items.

#### Take-aways

* Scalar subqueries inside `SELECT` clauses re-scan data per row, which is inefficient at scale.
* Using `JOIN` + `GROUP BY` allows aggregation over all rows in one pass.
* In Snowflake (and SQL in general), avoid row-by-row logic when a set-based operation is available.
* Especially in high-volume tables like `LINEITEM`, subqueries can quickly become the bottleneck.

Modify the query to return only the top 10 orders with the **most line items**, sorted in descending order of item count. This will help identify the most complex orders for fulfillment optimization.
