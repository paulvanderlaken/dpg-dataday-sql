## ex25: High/Low Discounting Suppliers per Segment

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 9 / 10

### Business context
Building on the customer deep dive, procurement leadership now wants to investigate the **supply side** of pricing. Specifically, they want to identify suppliers who exhibit **abnormally high or low discounting behavior** for the parts they provide. This helps uncover whether certain suppliers systematically undercut or overcharge, potentially affecting downstream profitability.

The analysis should flag outliers within each **market segment**, focusing only on the **top 10 customers** from the previous exercise. These accounts are strategic, and any excessive discounting tied to their orders may indicate negotiation leverage or poor margin control.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Supplier discount rate: average of all `L_DISCOUNT` values on orders they fulfill
* Outlier threshold: more than 1.5 standard deviations above or below segment mean
* Segment-scope: only include line items tied to the **top 10 customers per segment in 1995**

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview supplier and discounting info on line items
SELECT
    l.L_ORDERKEY,
    l.L_SUPPKEY,
    s.S_NAME,
    c.C_NAME,
    c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    l.L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
  ON l.L_ORDERKEY = o.O_ORDERKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
  ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s
  ON l.L_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`

#### How to think about it

Start by filtering for 1995 and limiting to only the top 10 customers per segment (use a subquery or CTE). Then group all their line items by `S_SUPPKEY` and `C_MKTSEGMENT`, and compute:
- average discount per supplier
- standard deviation and mean discount per segment
Finally, flag suppliers whose average is unusually high or low relative to segment peers.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `AVG()`, `STDDEV()`, `CTE`, `FILTER`, `OUTLIER DETECTION`

```sql
AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS avg_discount,
STDDEV(L_DISCOUNT) OVER (PARTITION BY C_MKTSEGMENT)
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH top_customers AS (
    SELECT C_CUSTKEY, C_MKTSEGMENT
    FROM (
        SELECT
            c.C_CUSTKEY,
            c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
            SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue,
            RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.C_MKTSEGMENT ORDER BY SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) DESC) AS rnk
        FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
        JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
        JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
        WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
        GROUP BY c.C_CUSTKEY, c.C_MKTSEGMENT
    )
    WHERE rnk <= 10
),
supplier_discounts AS (
    SELECT
        s.S_SUPPKEY,
        s.S_NAME,
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        AVG(l.L_DISCOUNT) AS avg_discount
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON l.L_ORDERKEY = o.O_ORDERKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s ON l.L_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
      AND c.C_CUSTKEY IN (SELECT C_CUSTKEY FROM top_customers)
    GROUP BY s.S_SUPPKEY, s.S_NAME, c.C_MKTSEGMENT
),
segment_stats AS (
    SELECT
        C_MKTSEGMENT,
        AVG(avg_discount) AS segment_avg,
        STDDEV(avg_discount) AS segment_std
    FROM supplier_discounts
    GROUP BY C_MKTSEGMENT
)
SELECT
    sd.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    sd.S_NAME,
    sd.avg_discount,
    ss.segment_avg,
    ss.segment_std,
    CASE
        WHEN sd.avg_discount > ss.segment_avg + 1.5 * ss.segment_std THEN 'High Outlier'
        WHEN sd.avg_discount < ss.segment_avg - 1.5 * ss.segment_std THEN 'Low Outlier'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS outlier_flag
FROM supplier_discounts sd
JOIN segment_stats ss
  ON sd.C_MKTSEGMENT = ss.C_MKTSEGMENT
ORDER BY C_MKTSEGMENT, avg_discount DESC;
```

#### Why this works

This query restricts the analysis to top customers, isolates the suppliers serving them, and compares supplier-level average discounts against segment-wide benchmarks using standard deviation. This flags anomalies in pricing behavior with statistical rigor.

#### Business answer

You now know which suppliers in each segment give unusually high or low discounts to top customers ‚Äî insights that could prompt renegotiations or audits.

#### Take-aways

* Outlier detection is a practical use of `AVG()` and `STDDEV()`
* Join chains with filters can isolate rich subpopulations (e.g. top customers only)
* Avoid hardcoding thresholds (e.g. `1.5`) ‚Äî use named parameters or config tables for flexibility and auditability
* Replace inline labels (like `"High Outlier"`) with controlled mappings or dimension tables for clarity and consistency

Also compute the **total revenue** per supplier for these top accounts. Highlight suppliers with both **high revenue contribution and outlier discounting**, as they are most likely to impact margins.
