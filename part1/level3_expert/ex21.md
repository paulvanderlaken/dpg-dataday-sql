## ex21: Customer Cohort Revenue Growth

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 8 / 10

### Business context
The strategy team is investigating how customer cohorts perform over time. Specifically, they want to group customers based on the month of their first-ever order and then observe how their cumulative revenue unfolds month by month. This view should help highlight whether newer cohorts ramp up faster than older ones, and inform investments in customer acquisition vs. retention.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* first purchase month: the month (truncated to YYYY-MM) of a customer's earliest order (`MIN(O_ORDERDATE)`)
* cohort: a group of customers who placed their first order in the same month
* monthly revenue: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))` grouped by order ship month
* cumulative revenue: sum of monthly revenue, growing over time per cohort

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview orders and shipment data with dates and keys
SELECT
    O_ORDERKEY,
    O_CUSTKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    L_SHIPDATE,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
  ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

Start by calculating the *first order month* for each customer. Then assign that as the cohort label. Next, compute revenue per shipped order line, grouped by the shipping month and cohort. Finally, apply a cumulative window function to accumulate the revenue over time **within each cohort**.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`CTE`, `JOIN`, `DATE_TRUNC`, `SUM()`, `OVER (PARTITION BY ‚Ä¶ ORDER BY ‚Ä¶ ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', O_ORDERDATE) AS month FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS;
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH first_order_month AS (
    SELECT
        C_CUSTKEY,
        DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', MIN(O_ORDERDATE)) AS cohort_month
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
      ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY C_CUSTKEY
),
monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        f.cohort_month,
        DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', l.L_SHIPDATE) AS revenue_month,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS monthly_revenue
    FROM first_order_month f
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
      ON f.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
      ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    GROUP BY f.cohort_month, DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', l.L_SHIPDATE)
)
SELECT
    cohort_month,
    revenue_month,
    monthly_revenue,
    SUM(monthly_revenue) OVER (
        PARTITION BY cohort_month
        ORDER BY revenue_month
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_revenue
FROM monthly_revenue
ORDER BY cohort_month, revenue_month;
```

#### Why this works

This query:
1. Determines each customer's **first order month** to define their cohort.
2. Aggregates revenue by **shipping month** for each cohort.
3. Uses a **window frame** to compute the cumulative sum of revenue over time within each cohort.

It‚Äôs highly composable and uses Snowflake‚Äôs efficient analytic functions for performance.

#### Business answer

You now have a view of how revenue evolves for each customer cohort over time, from their initial purchase month onward.

#### Take-aways

* Understand how to compute and assign **customer cohorts** based on behavioral data
* Practice **date bucketing** and **cumulative window functions**
* Remember to **join through the orders table** to associate line items with customers
* Window frames (`ROWS BETWEEN`) can greatly improve readability and precision in cumulative metrics

<summary>üéÅ Bonus Exercise (click to expand)</summary>

Instead of total revenue, compute the **average order value (AOV)** per month for each cohort, and compare how this evolves over time. Does any cohort maintain higher AOV over their lifecycle?

To do this:
- Count the number of unique orders per cohort/month,
- Divide total revenue by that count,
- Then compute cumulative **average AOV** per cohort.
