## ex16: Rank Orders with Total Spend

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
Finance is auditing high-value purchases and wants to understand spending patterns per customer. Specifically, they want to rank each customer's orders by total spend, defined as the sum of all line item prices *after discount* for that order. This helps identify which transactions drive most value and supports customer profitability analysis. Your task is to compute this total spend and return a ranked list of orders per customer.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Previewing line item-level spend detail
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

To rank orders by customer, start by calculating each order's total spend using the formula: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))`. This gives the actual amount earned after discount. Join that back to the `ORDERS` table to retrieve customer IDs, and apply a window function to rank the orders within each customer.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN, GROUP BY, SUM, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY â€¦ ORDER BY â€¦)`

```sql
SELECT
    â€¦,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY total_spend DESC) AS order_rank
FROM â€¦
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    O.O_CUSTKEY,
    O.O_ORDERKEY,
    ORDER_SPEND.TOTAL_SPEND,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY O.O_CUSTKEY
        ORDER BY ORDER_SPEND.TOTAL_SPEND DESC
    ) AS ORDER_RANK
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN (
    SELECT
        L_ORDERKEY,
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS TOTAL_SPEND
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
    GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY
) ORDER_SPEND
    ON O.O_ORDERKEY = ORDER_SPEND.L_ORDERKEY
ORDER BY O.O_CUSTKEY, ORDER_RANK;
```

#### Why this works

The subquery computes total post-discount revenue per order. By joining this result to the `ORDERS` table, we get the customer key for each order. Applying `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` allows us to rank each customerâ€™s orders from highest to lowest spend.

#### Business answer

You now have a per-customer ranking of their orders based on spend after discount â€” helping identify top transactions and customer revenue concentration.

#### Take-aways

* Learn how to compute and rank transactions using `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY`.
* Understand the concept of total spend: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))`.
* Efficiently combine aggregation with window functions for rich analytical outputs.
* Be mindful of join directions and cardinality when combining aggregates and detail-level data.
