## ex16: Rank Orders with Total Spend

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
Following your customer recency analysis, the finance team now wants to know which orders were the **most valuable** ‚Äî not just how often customers ordered, but which individual transactions drove the highest revenue.

By computing the total spend per order and ranking them per customer, you'll help finance pinpoint high-impact purchases ‚Äî useful for account tiering, relationship management, and revenue concentration analysis.

### Business logic & definitions

* **Total order spend**: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE √ó (1 ‚àí L_DISCOUNT))` grouped by `L_ORDERKEY`
* **Customer linkage**: Use `O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY` and `O_CUSTKEY` to attribute each order to a customer
* **Ranking**: Use `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `O_CUSTKEY`, ordered by spend descending

### Starter query
```sql
-- Previewing line item-level spend detail
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

First, compute total spend per order by grouping `LINEITEM` by `L_ORDERKEY`. Then join that back to `ORDERS` to retrieve the customer ID. Use a window function to rank orders **within each customer** by total spend. Sorting the final result helps make this order explicit.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ‚Ä¶ ORDER BY ‚Ä¶)`

```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  order_id,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY total DESC) AS rank
FROM ‚Ä¶
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    O.O_CUSTKEY,
    O.O_ORDERKEY,
    ORDER_SPEND.TOTAL_SPEND,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY O.O_CUSTKEY
        ORDER BY ORDER_SPEND.TOTAL_SPEND DESC
    ) AS ORDER_RANK
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN (
    SELECT
        L_ORDERKEY,
        SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS TOTAL_SPEND
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
    GROUP BY L_ORDERKEY
) ORDER_SPEND
    ON O.O_ORDERKEY = ORDER_SPEND.L_ORDERKEY
ORDER BY O.O_CUSTKEY, ORDER_RANK;
```

#### Why this works

The subquery computes the post-discount spend per order. Joining it with `ORDERS` allows the query to retrieve each order‚Äôs customer. Using `ROW_NUMBER()` with a `PARTITION BY` clause creates a clean per-customer ranking, enabling clear revenue concentration analysis.

#### Business answer

You now have a per-customer ranking of their orders by spend, allowing the finance team to pinpoint which transactions contributed most to each customer‚Äôs value.

#### Take-aways

* `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` is the standard way to rank values **within a group**.
* Aggregation followed by join-back is a powerful strategy for layering business context.
* Understand the distinction between `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `DENSE_RANK` when working with window functions.
* Be aware of join direction and cardinality when combining aggregated and base-level data.

Limit the result to the **top 3 orders per customer** using a `QUALIFY` clause. This will help the team focus on a customer‚Äôs most valuable transactions only.
