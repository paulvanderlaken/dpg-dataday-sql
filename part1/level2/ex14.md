## ex14: Detailed Order Feed with Derived Cost

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 5 / 10

### Business context
The finance team is building a foundational **daily revenue feed** to support the pricing, sales, and customer teams. This feed will provide a transaction-level view of each shipped item ‚Äî including quantities, item pricing, and post-discount revenue ‚Äî and will serve as the **core dataset** for all upcoming dashboards and analytics.

Your job is to generate this enriched dataset, which brings together order dates, part names, and per-item net revenue. This unified feed will soon power segmentation models, profitability rankings, and customer lifecycle views.

### Business logic & definitions

* **Net revenue per line item**: `L_EXTENDEDPRICE √ó (1 ‚àí L_DISCOUNT)`
* **Join keys**:
  * Lineitem ‚Üí Order: `L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY`
  * Lineitem ‚Üí Part: `L_PARTKEY = P_PARTKEY`
* **Feed scope**: Return all records (no filtering) ‚Äî this is the full transaction layer


### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview basic order and item info
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`

#### How to think about it

Join `LINEITEM` to `ORDERS` and `PART` using their respective keys to bring in order date and part name. Compute net revenue directly in the `SELECT` clause using the correct discount formula. Don‚Äôt filter ‚Äî this is meant to be a base layer for downstream aggregation and analysis.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, column expressions, multi-table joins

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2 * (1 - discount) AS derived_value
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON ‚Ä¶
JOIN table3 ON ‚Ä¶;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    O.O_ORDERDATE,
    O.O_ORDERKEY,
    P.P_NAME AS part_name,
    L.L_QUANTITY,
    L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L.L_DISCOUNT,
    L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L.L_DISCOUNT) AS net_revenue
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM L
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
    ON L.L_ORDERKEY = O.O_ORDERKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART P
    ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY;
```

#### Why this works

This query joins each line item to its order and the associated part, allowing us to include both contextual and commercial data. The `net_revenue` field is derived inline by applying the discount to the extended price. The absence of a `WHERE` clause ensures the result includes the full transactional feed.

#### Business answer

You now have a comprehensive transaction feed with order dates, part names, item quantities, and derived revenue ‚Äî ready for use in finance dashboards and further analytics.

#### Take-aways

* Derived metrics (like revenue after discount) can be computed directly in `SELECT` using arithmetic expressions.
* When combining multiple tables, be deliberate with join keys to ensure clean one-to-many relationships.
* This query serves as a ‚Äúfact feed‚Äù ‚Äî raw, unfiltered, detailed ‚Äî often used as input to later layers of analysis or reporting.
* Avoid filtering when constructing base feeds unless the use case explicitly demands it.

Filter the transaction feed to include only items **shipped in the year 1997** using `L_SHIPDATE`. 
This will produce a **year-specific feed** suitable for historical dashboards and time-trended financial analysis.

You can reuse this structure later to power annual or quarterly time slices.
