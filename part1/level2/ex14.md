## ex14: Detailed Order Feed with Derived Cost

> **Type:** Core  
> **Difficulty:** 5 / 10

### Business context
Finance is setting up a new dashboard to monitor daily order revenue and needs a detailed transaction feed. This feed should include all key identifiers along with the *net revenue* per line item â€” that is, the extended price after discount. This enriched dataset will serve as the base layer for tracking order performance and margin contribution over time.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview basic order and item info
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`

#### How to think about it

This query needs to join `LINEITEM` to `ORDERS` (via `L_ORDERKEY`) and to `PART` (via `L_PARTKEY`) to retrieve order dates and part names. Then, you must compute the discounted revenue directly in the `SELECT` clause. Avoid filtering â€” this is a base feed.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, column expressions in `SELECT`, multi-table joins

```sql
SELECT
    price * (1 - discount) AS net_price
FROM table
JOIN other_table ON â€¦
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    O.O_ORDERDATE,
    O.O_ORDERKEY,
    P.P_NAME AS part_name,
    L.L_QUANTITY,
    L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L.L_DISCOUNT,
    L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L.L_DISCOUNT) AS net_revenue
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM L
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
    ON L.L_ORDERKEY = O.O_ORDERKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART P
    ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY;
```

#### Why this works

This query links each line item to its order and the corresponding part. It computes a derived field, `net_revenue`, by applying the discount to `L_EXTENDEDPRICE`. No filters are used so the feed remains complete and usable for downstream aggregations.

#### Business answer

You now have a full order-level feed that includes order dates, item quantities, part names, and calculated net revenue for each transaction.

#### Take-aways

* You can derive new columns directly in the `SELECT` clause using expressions.
* Always confirm join keys when using multi-table joins to avoid duplicate or missing rows.
* Precomputing derived metrics like revenue saves downstream users from repeating logic.
