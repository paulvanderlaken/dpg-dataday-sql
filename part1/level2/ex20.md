## ex20: Rolling Daily Revenue Since Jan 1 1996

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
The finance team is now building an executive dashboard to visualize **cumulative revenue trends** over time. They're looking for patterns that reveal **seasonality**, **growth velocity**, and **market shifts**.

To support this, they‚Äôve asked for a time series that shows **daily net revenue since January 1st, 1996**, along with a rolling total. This view will underpin trend charts and drive quarterly planning.


**Business logic & definitions:**
* revenue per line item: `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`
* cumulative daily revenue: running total of daily revenue, ordered by `L_SHIPDATE`
* start date: include only line items shipped **on or after 1996-01-01**

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview shipping dates and revenue-related fields
SELECT
    L_SHIPDATE,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
WHERE L_SHIPDATE >= DATE '1996-01-01'
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

1. First, group the data by `L_SHIPDATE` and compute **daily revenue** using the expression `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`.
2. Then, apply a **cumulative window** using `SUM(...) OVER (ORDER BY L_SHIPDATE)` to create a running total over days.

#### What‚Äôs `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`?

This clause defines the *frame* of rows included in your windowed aggregation. By default, `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY L_SHIPDATE)` already uses this frame ‚Äî but being explicit is:
- clearer,
- more portable to other window patterns (e.g. moving averages),
- safer when using functions like `AVG()` or non-numeric window specs.

It means:  
> ‚ÄúFor the current row, look at all previous rows (back to the first), and sum everything up to this one.‚Äù

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `SUM() OVER(ORDER BY ‚Ä¶)`, window frame specification

```sql
SELECT
    date_col,
    SUM(metric) AS daily_val,
    SUM(metric) OVER(
        ORDER BY date_col
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_val
FROM ‚Ä¶
WHERE date_col >= ‚Ä¶
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_SHIPDATE,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS daily_revenue,
    SUM(SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))) OVER (
        ORDER BY L_SHIPDATE
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS rolling_cumulative_revenue
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
WHERE L_SHIPDATE >= DATE '1996-01-01'
GROUP BY L_SHIPDATE
ORDER BY L_SHIPDATE;
```

#### Why this works

The query aggregates daily revenue and then uses a **cumulative window function** to track revenue growth over time. The explicit frame clause ensures the running total includes all prior dates ‚Äî a must-know pattern for time series.

#### Business answer

You now have a daily view of revenue growth since January 1, 1996 ‚Äî ideal for trend and seasonality tracking.

#### Take-aways

* How to compute rolling aggregates using window functions
* Window frame clauses (like `ROWS BETWEEN`) give precise control over cumulative logic
* Pre-filtering for relevant timeframes improves performance
* Best practice: always define the frame explicitly to avoid ambiguity

<summary>üéÅ Bonus Exercise (click to expand)</summary>

Modify the query to also return the **7-day moving average** of daily revenue. This can help smooth out short-term spikes and better reveal underlying trends. You‚Äôll need to use a second window function like:

```sql
AVG(daily_revenue) OVER (
  ORDER BY L_SHIPDATE
  ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```
