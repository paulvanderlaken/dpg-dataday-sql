## ex11: Revenue by Part and Discount Tier

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 4 / 10

### Business context
The sales team is preparing its annual performance review for 1998 and needs to understand which parts truly drove the business. They‚Äôre especially curious about how different discount levels impacted revenue ‚Äî did lowering prices boost volume enough to pay off?

Your analysis will set the foundation for their pricing strategy going into 1999. In this first step, you're helping them pinpoint which parts performed best under which discount tiers ‚Äî the first clue in uncovering pricing sweet spots.

### Business logic & definitions

* **Net revenue**: The actual income per line item, calculated as `L_EXTENDEDPRICE √ó (1 ‚àí L_DISCOUNT)`
* **Discount tier**: The specific discount applied to a sale, captured in `L_DISCOUNT` (e.g., 0.10 = 10%)
* **1998 filter**: Line items where `L_SHIPDATE` falls between `1998-01-01` and `1998-12-31`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview key columns relevant to revenue and discount logic
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    L_SHIPDATE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

#### How to think about it

Start by filtering line items that were shipped in 1998. Then calculate *net revenue* using `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`.  
Group the results by both `L_PARTKEY` and `L_DISCOUNT` to explore how revenue changes across discount tiers for each part. Use `ORDER BY` to surface the most valuable combinations.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, arithmetic expressions

```sql
SELECT category, subcategory, SUM(metric)
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY category, subcategory;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN DATE '1998-01-01' AND DATE '1998-12-31'
GROUP BY L_PARTKEY, L_DISCOUNT
ORDER BY REVENUE DESC;
```

#### Why this works

The query filters to all line items shipped in 1998. Revenue is calculated by applying the discount rate to the extended price. Grouping by both part and discount level allows comparison of revenue performance across discount tiers. Sorting by revenue surfaces the most profitable part-discount combinations.

#### Business answer

Some parts achieved peak revenue under specific discount tiers ‚Äî revealing which pricing levels triggered the most lucrative demand responses in 1998.

#### Take-aways

* Derived metrics like net revenue can be computed directly in the `SELECT` clause.
* Grouping by multiple dimensions allows tier-based comparisons ‚Äî e.g., by part and discount level.
* Avoid wrapping date columns in functions like `YEAR()` when filtering, as this prevents filter pushdown and slows down large queries.
* Sorting aggregated outputs is a useful way to spot patterns without needing a `TOP N` clause.

Modify the query to return only the **top 5 most profitable parts** for each discount tier. Use a window function such as `RANK()` or `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `L_DISCOUNT` to do this. This will help the pricing team identify which parts are most responsive at each discount level.
