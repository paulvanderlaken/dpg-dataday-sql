## ex11: Revenue by Part and Discount Tier

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 4 / 10

### Business context
The sales analytics team is reviewing full-year performance to inform next year's pricing strategy. To support this, they need to know which parts brought in the most revenue in 1998 ‚Äî and how that revenue varies across discount levels. This helps them understand the sweet spot where discounts drive higher sales volume without eroding profitability.  
In this analysis, *revenue* refers to the net amount billed per item after accounting for any discounts. That is: the full item price multiplied by (1 - discount rate).

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview key columns relevant to revenue and discount logic
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    L_SHIPDATE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

#### How to think about it

Start by filtering all line items that were shipped during the 1998 calendar year. Use the discount column to calculate the *net revenue* for each item. The correct formula is:  
`Net Revenue = L_EXTENDEDPRICE √ó (1 ‚àí L_DISCOUNT)`  
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: `L_DISCOUNT` is stored as a decimal ‚Äî for example, 0.10 represents a 10% discount.

Then group your results by both part (`L_PARTKEY`) and discount level (`L_DISCOUNT`) to explore how different discount strategies influenced total revenue per part. Sorting by revenue will help you identify the most profitable combinations.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY, SUM, arithmetic expressions`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, SUM(expression) 
FROM table 
WHERE condition 
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN DATE '1998-01-01' AND DATE '1998-12-31'
GROUP BY L_PARTKEY, L_DISCOUNT
ORDER BY REVENUE DESC;
```

#### Why this works

This query filters to all line items shipped in 1998. The revenue calculation correctly applies the discount using `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`. Grouping by both `L_PARTKEY` and `L_DISCOUNT` allows us to see the effect of discount levels on revenue for each part. Finally, sorting by total revenue highlights which combinations were most financially impactful.

#### Business answer

In 1998, certain parts reached peak revenue at specific discount levels ‚Äî suggesting that well-calibrated discounts can significantly boost profitability without heavily sacrificing margin.

#### Take-aways

* Net revenue is calculated as `L_EXTENDEDPRICE √ó (1 ‚àí L_DISCOUNT)`.
* Use range filters (`BETWEEN`, `>=`, `<=`) on raw dates ‚Äî avoid wrapping date columns in functions (e.g. `YEAR()`), as this hurts performance.
* Sorting results helps uncover "pricing sweet spots" ‚Äî a key tool in commercial analytics.
