## ex13: Orders per Customer in 1995

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 4 / 10

### Business context
With key parts and pricing tiers now under review, attention is shifting to the demand side of the equation: who was actually placing the orders?

The sales team wants to understand customer behavior across regions in 1995 ‚Äî a year they suspect was pivotal for international expansion. They're looking for a clear view of who ordered what, when, and from where, to tailor upcoming territory-specific campaigns and understand which customer segments were most active in that year.

### Business logic & definitions

* **Customer nationality**: Join `CUSTOMER` to `NATION` via `C_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY`
* **Order placement**: Captured in `ORDERS` via `O_ORDERDATE`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Inspect order records with customer and order dates
SELECT
    O_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_CUSTKEY
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION`

#### How to think about it

Start by joining the `ORDERS` table to `CUSTOMER` using `O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY`. Then join to `NATION` to get the customer‚Äôs country. Finally, apply a `WHERE` clause to restrict the result to orders placed in 1995 using `O_ORDERDATE`. This will give you the full picture: who ordered, from where, and when.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`INNER JOIN`, `DATE` filtering, table linking

```sql
SELECT ‚Ä¶
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON ‚Ä¶
JOIN table3 ON ‚Ä¶
WHERE date_column BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-12-31';
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C.C_NAME,
    N.N_NAME AS nation,
    O.O_ORDERDATE,
    O.O_ORDERKEY
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
    ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION N
    ON C.C_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY
WHERE O.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-12-31';
```

#### Why this works

This query connects orders to their originating customers and then links those customers to their nation of origin. The `WHERE` clause filters only the 1995 orders, producing a time-specific view of cross-national customer activity.

#### Business answer

You now have a full listing of all customers who placed orders in 1995, when they ordered, and which nation they came from ‚Äî perfect for planning regional engagement strategies.

#### Take-aways

* Multi-table joins can unlock rich, joined dimensions (e.g. customer + geography + date).
* Use `WHERE` clauses for filtering **before aggregation**.
* Correct join keys (like `C_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY`) are essential for avoiding cartesian products or mismatches.
* Filtering early by date keeps large datasets manageable and improves performance.

Extend your query to also return the customer‚Äôs market segment (`C_MKTSEGMENT`). This will allow the sales team to analyze **which segments were most active in 1995**, across nations ‚Äî key input for adjusting campaign messaging and regional priorities.

For extra insight, consider sorting by nation and segment.
