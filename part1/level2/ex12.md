## ex12: High-Volume Parts with Tiered Revenue

> **Type:** Core  
> **Difficulty:** 5 / 10

### Business context
The operations team is revisiting procurement priorities for the next quarter. They want to identify parts that are both high in volume and high in financial impact. Specifically, they are interested in parts that have sold over 1,000 units and have generated more than $100,000 in revenue, so they can assess supplier performance and negotiate better terms for these critical items.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Explore quantities and pricing across parts
SELECT * 
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

You are looking for parts that meet **two aggregate conditions**: a total quantity threshold and a revenue threshold. Start by grouping the data by `L_PARTKEY`, then use aggregate functions like `SUM()` to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue generated. Use a `HAVING` clause to filter based on those aggregate results. 

Remember to account for discounting!

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `HAVING`

```sql
SELECT column, SUM(amount)
FROM table
GROUP BY column
HAVING SUM(amount) > value;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_PARTKEY,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS total_quantity,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
GROUP BY L_PARTKEY
HAVING 
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) >= 1000
    AND SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) > 100000;
```

#### Why this works

This query groups all line items by part, then calculates total quantity and discounted revenue per part. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only parts meeting both conditions (â‰¥1,000 units sold and >$100K in revenue) are returned. Applying `SUM()` over expressions like `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)` computes net revenue after discount.

#### Business answer

Only parts with both high volume and high revenue impact are included â€” these are critical for procurement negotiations.

#### Take-aways

* You can use `HAVING` to filter results **after aggregation**, unlike `WHERE`.
* Always apply business logic to **derived values**, such as discounted revenue, inside aggregate functions.
* For large datasets, use filtering on the date column (`L_SHIPDATE`) early to reduce scan time â€” e.g., for a specific year or quarter.
