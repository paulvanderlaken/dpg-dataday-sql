## ex12: High-Volume Parts with Tiered Revenue

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 5 / 10

### Business context
After your pricing tier analysis, the operations team has picked up the thread: they're eager to understand which parts **move both in volume and value**. Knowing which parts consistently generate strong revenue **and** sell in large quantities will help procurement renegotiate terms and prioritize sourcing.

This analysis adds a second lens to your previous work ‚Äî one focused not just on how discounts affect revenue, but on which parts are truly critical due to their combined financial and operational footprint.

### Business logic & definitions


* **Total quantity sold**: `SUM(L_QUANTITY)` grouped by `L_PARTKEY`
* **Total net revenue**: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE √ó (1 ‚àí L_DISCOUNT))` grouped by `L_PARTKEY`
* **High-impact part**: Any part that exceeds both thresholds:
    * At least 1,000 units sold 
    * More than $2,500,000 in revenue

### Starter query
```sql
-- Explore quantities and pricing across parts
SELECT
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_QUANTITY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

You are looking for parts that meet **two aggregate conditions**: a total quantity threshold and a revenue threshold. Start by grouping the data by `L_PARTKEY`, then use aggregate functions like `SUM()` to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue generated. Use a `HAVING` clause to filter based on those aggregate results. 

Remember to account for discounting!

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `HAVING`

```sql
SELECT column, SUM(amount)
FROM table
GROUP BY column
HAVING SUM(amount) > value;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_PARTKEY,
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS total_quantity,
    SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
GROUP BY L_PARTKEY
HAVING 
    SUM(L_QUANTITY) >= 1000
    AND SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) > 2500000;
```

#### Why this works

This query groups all line items by part, then calculates total quantity and discounted revenue per part. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only parts meeting both conditions (‚â•1,000 units sold and >$2,5M in revenue) are returned. Applying `SUM()` over expressions like `L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)` computes net revenue after discount.

#### Business answer

Only a subset of parts meet both volume and revenue criteria ‚Äî these should be prioritized for supplier negotiation and procurement streamlining.

#### Take-aways

* Use `HAVING` (not `WHERE`) to filter on results of aggregate functions like `SUM()`.
* Derived metrics can be computed inline within `SUM()`, allowing direct application of business rules.
* Filtering early reduces scan time, greatly improving performance, especially on large(r) datasets

Add the average discount per qualifying part to your result. This will help the procurement team assess whether these high-revenue, high-volume parts rely heavily on discounting ‚Äî or whether their performance is driven by genuine demand.

For an extra challenge, sort your results to highlight parts with high revenue and low average discounts ‚Äî ideal targets for profitable prioritization.
