## ex19: Deep Discount Lineitems per Order

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
The pricing team is investigating the **impact of aggressive discounting**. Are deep discounts concentrated in a few standout items per order, or spread across the board?

To find out, they‚Äôve asked for a listing of the **top 5 most heavily discounted line items per order**, but only for discounts of 8% or more. This will help them gauge whether certain deals are eroding margins in isolated cases ‚Äî or if broader patterns exist.


**Business logic & definitions:**
* deep discount: any line item where `L_DISCOUNT >= 0.08`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview of discount data in the line items
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_LINENUMBER,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

Start by filtering all line items with a discount of at least 8%. Then use a window function to rank them **within each order** (`L_ORDERKEY`) by discount size. Keep only the top 5 per order using `QUALIFY`. Be sure to consider ties ‚Äî use `RANK()` to allow them, or `ROW_NUMBER()` for strict top-N selection.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WHERE`, `RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ORDER BY)`, `QUALIFY`

```sql
SELECT ‚Ä¶, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY metric DESC)
FROM ‚Ä¶ WHERE ‚Ä¶
QUALIFY rank_col <= N;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_LINENUMBER,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_DISCOUNT,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
WHERE L_DISCOUNT >= 0.08
QUALIFY RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY L_ORDERKEY
    ORDER BY L_DISCOUNT DESC
) <= 5;
```

#### Why this works

The query filters for ‚Äúdeep discounts‚Äù of 8% or more, ranks these within each order using `RANK()`, and uses `QUALIFY` to return the top 5 per order. This avoids subqueries and performs well even on larger datasets.

#### Business answer

You now have, for each order, the top 5 most heavily discounted line items where the discount was at least 8%.

#### Take-aways

* Learned how to apply a window function partitioned by a business entity (`L_ORDERKEY`)
* Learned the use of `QUALIFY` to filter by rank after windowing
* `RANK()` allows ties ‚Äî may return more than 5 items in rare cases
* Realistic discount threshold ensures meaningful, non-empty results

Extend this query to compute the **total extended price** of the top 5 discounted items per order. This will help quantify the revenue exposure to heavy discounting. Wrap the query in a CTE or subquery, then group by `L_ORDERKEY`.
