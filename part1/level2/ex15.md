## ex15: Customers with Recency and Order Count

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 6 / 10

### Business context
With the new transaction feed in place, the customer relationship team is turning its attention to **lifecycle segmentation**. They want to identify which customers are currently active ‚Äî and which might need re-engagement.

Specifically, they‚Äôve asked for a list showing **each customer‚Äôs most recent order date and total number of orders**. Customers with many past orders but no recent activity could be candidates for win-back campaigns, while active repeat customers are perfect upsell targets.

### Business logic & definitions

* **Recency**: The latest order date per customer, calculated using `MAX(O_ORDERDATE)`
* **Frequency**: Total number of orders per customer, calculated using `COUNT(*)`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview customers and their related orders
SELECT
    C_CUSTKEY,
    C_NAME,
    O_ORDERDATE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
    ON C.C_CUSTKEY = O.O_CUSTKEY
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`

#### How to think about it

Use a subquery that groups by `O_CUSTKEY` to calculate both `MAX(O_ORDERDATE)` and `COUNT(*)`. Then join that result back to the `CUSTOMER` table so you can retrieve the customer name and other metadata. Sort the result by recency to bring the most recently active customers to the top.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`GROUP BY`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, subquery in `FROM`, join with aggregate

```sql
SELECT ‚Ä¶
FROM (
  SELECT customer_id, MAX(date), COUNT(*) ‚Ä¶
  FROM ORDERS
  GROUP BY customer_id
) agg
JOIN CUSTOMER ON ‚Ä¶
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    C.C_NAME,
    C.C_CUSTKEY,
    OINFO.RECENT_ORDER_DATE,
    OINFO.ORDER_COUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT
        O_CUSTKEY,
        MAX(O_ORDERDATE) AS RECENT_ORDER_DATE,
        COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
    GROUP BY O_CUSTKEY
) OINFO
    ON C.C_CUSTKEY = OINFO.O_CUSTKEY
ORDER BY OINFO.RECENT_ORDER_DATE DESC;
```

#### Why this works

The subquery (`OINFO`) calculates recency and frequency of orders per customer. Joining it back to the `CUSTOMER` table allows you to enrich that data with readable customer names. Sorting by `RECENT_ORDER_DATE` provides a quick view of which customers are currently active ‚Äî and who might need re-engagement.

#### Business answer

The team now has a clear snapshot of which customers are actively ordering and which have gone quiet ‚Äî enabling smarter segmentation and outreach.

#### Take-aways

* You can join **aggregated results** back to a base table to enrich summaries with readable attributes.
* `MAX()` and `COUNT()` are standard tools for recency/frequency analysis.
* Always double-check join keys and cardinality ‚Äî `CUSTOMER` is 1-to-many with `ORDERS`.
* Use descending order on recency fields to surface recent activity at the top of your result set.

Limit the result to customers who placed **more than 5 orders**. These are your **engaged customers** ‚Äî a high-priority group for loyalty programs, satisfaction surveys, and targeted offers.

You can add a `HAVING` clause to the subquery to apply this threshold.
