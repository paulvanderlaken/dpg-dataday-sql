## ex24: Strategic Customers per Segment ‚Äî Deep Dive (1995)

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 8 / 10

### Business context
Sales leadership is preparing for the annual review and needs a diagnostic of the **top 1% of customers by segment** for 1995. These elite accounts represent disproportionate revenue share and may deserve differentiated contracting, support, or pricing policies.

You‚Äôve been asked to identify these customers and provide a full profile:
- How much revenue they generated
- How many orders they placed
- How many line items were included
- What discounts they received

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Net revenue: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))`
* Order count: count of distinct orders placed in 1995
* Line count: number of line items across all orders in 1995
* Average discount: `AVG(L_DISCOUNT)`
* Threshold: customers above the **99th percentile** in segment-level revenue

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview customer revenue patterns by segment
SELECT
    c.C_CUSTKEY,
    c.C_NAME,
    c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    l.L_DISCOUNT,
    o.O_ORDERDATE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

First calculate total net revenue per customer per segment for 1995. Then use `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99)` to determine the **segment-specific revenue threshold**. Return customers above this threshold and compute additional metrics using aggregation and joins.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`PERCENTILE_CONT`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `CTE`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `FILTER`

```sql
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) FROM ‚Ä¶;
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH customer_rev AS (
    SELECT
        c.C_CUSTKEY,
        c.C_NAME,
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
    GROUP BY c.C_CUSTKEY, c.C_NAME, c.C_MKTSEGMENT
),
cutoffs AS (
    SELECT
        C_MKTSEGMENT,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS revenue_threshold
    FROM customer_rev
    GROUP BY C_MKTSEGMENT
),
top_customers AS (
    SELECT cr.*
    FROM customer_rev cr
    JOIN cutoffs c ON cr.C_MKTSEGMENT = c.C_MKTSEGMENT
    WHERE cr.revenue >= c.revenue_threshold
),
detailed_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        tc.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        tc.C_NAME,
        tc.C_CUSTKEY,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.O_ORDERKEY) AS order_count,
        COUNT(*) AS line_count,
        AVG(l.L_DISCOUNT) AS avg_discount,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS net_revenue
    FROM top_customers tc
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON tc.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
    GROUP BY tc.C_MKTSEGMENT, tc.C_NAME, tc.C_CUSTKEY
)
SELECT *
FROM detailed_metrics
ORDER BY C_MKTSEGMENT, net_revenue DESC;
```

#### Why this works

The query first calculates total revenue by customer, applies a **segment-specific percentile cutoff**, and then enriches the subset with KPIs like discount, order count, and line count. This supports strategic customer-level analysis.

#### Business answer

You now have a profile of the top 1% of customers per segment ‚Äî ideal candidates for strategic pricing, account management, or contract renegotiation.

#### Take-aways

* Practice using **percentiles (`PERCENTILE_CONT`)** to define dynamic, data-driven thresholds
* Learn how to **aggregate and join across dimensions** (customers, orders, line items) for enriched reporting
* Improve fluency with **multi-layered CTEs** to structure complex logic clearly
* Understand how to **profile entities** (e.g. customers) using custom metrics like order count, discount rate, and revenue

Add a new column: `net_revenue / order_count` to calculate **average order value**. Then flag any customers with **above-average revenue per order and below-average discount** across their segment ‚Äî these are your ‚Äúpremium yield‚Äù customers.
