## ex24: Top 10 Customers per Segment ‚Äì Deep Dive (1995)

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 7 / 10

### Business context
Sales leadership is preparing for the annual review and wants a full diagnostic of the **top 10 customers per segment** for 1995. The team isn‚Äôt just interested in who spent the most ‚Äî they want to understand customer profiles: how many orders they placed, how many lines those orders included, and how much discounting was involved.

The goal is to identify the most valuable and consistent accounts by segment, and evaluate pricing behavior to inform future contracting strategies.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Total revenue: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))`
* Total discount amount: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT)`
* Avg discount: `AVG(L_DISCOUNT)`
* Line count: number of line items across all orders
* Order count: number of distinct orders placed
* Time filter: all orders placed in 1995

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview enriched order and line item records
SELECT
    o.O_ORDERKEY,
    o.O_ORDERDATE,
    c.C_NAME,
    c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    l.L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
  ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
  ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

Filter all orders to the year 1995. Then:
1. Join `CUSTOMER`, `ORDERS`, and `LINEITEM`
2. Group by customer and segment to calculate order count, line count, total revenue, and discount stats
3. Rank customers by total revenue within their segment
4. Return only the **top 10 per segment**

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ‚Ä¶ ORDER BY ‚Ä¶ DESC)`

```sql
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY C_MKTSEGMENT ORDER BY total_revenue DESC)
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH orders_1995 AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
    WHERE YEAR(O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
),
line_enriched AS (
    SELECT
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        c.C_CUSTKEY,
        c.C_NAME,
        o.O_ORDERKEY,
        l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
        l.L_DISCOUNT,
        l.L_LINENUMBER,
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS net_revenue,
        L_EXTENDEDPRICE * L_DISCOUNT AS discount_value
    FROM orders_1995 o
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
      ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
      ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
),
customer_agg AS (
    SELECT
        C_MKTSEGMENT,
        C_CUSTKEY,
        C_NAME,
        COUNT(DISTINCT O_ORDERKEY) AS total_orders,
        COUNT(*) AS total_lines,
        SUM(net_revenue) AS total_revenue,
        SUM(discount_value) AS total_discount_amt,
        AVG(L_DISCOUNT) AS avg_discount_pct
    FROM line_enriched
    GROUP BY C_MKTSEGMENT, C_CUSTKEY, C_NAME
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT *,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY C_MKTSEGMENT ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS rank_in_segment
    FROM customer_agg
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked
WHERE rank_in_segment <= 10
ORDER BY C_MKTSEGMENT, rank_in_segment;
```

#### Why this works

This query tracks all order-level activity for each customer in 1995 and aggregates key metrics that reflect both volume and value. By ranking within each segment, it helps spotlight top customers that may merit commercial follow-up.

#### Business answer

You now have a full diagnostic of the top 10 customers per segment, complete with revenue, order behavior, and discounting patterns ‚Äî ideal for QBRs and sales planning.

#### Take-aways

* `RANK()` is a powerful way to get top-N per group
* Joining line-level and customer-level data enables rich KPI profiles
* Even synthetic datasets like TPCH can reveal realistic procurement patterns
* Don't overlook discounts: they have real revenue impact
