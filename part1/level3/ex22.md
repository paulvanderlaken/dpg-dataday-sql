## ex22: Top 3 Parts by Revenue in Each Region

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 8 / 10

### Business context
Regional managers are revamping their procurement plans and want to know which parts are performing best in their regions. To support this, we‚Äôve been asked to identify the top 3 parts by revenue in each region. Since revenue flows from customers back through suppliers, it‚Äôs crucial to follow the full chain: from region to nation, to supplier, to the parts they supply, and finally to the actual revenue-generating line items.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* part revenue: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))` across all line items
* region for a part: derived through supplier ‚Üí nation ‚Üí region
* top 3 parts: ranked by revenue within each region using `RANK()`

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview supplier geography and part supply details
SELECT
    s.S_SUPPKEY,
    s.S_NAME,
    n.N_NAME AS nation,
    r.R_NAME AS region,
    ps.PS_PARTKEY,
    ps.PS_SUPPLYCOST
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION n
  ON s.S_NATIONKEY = n.N_NATIONKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.REGION r
  ON n.N_REGIONKEY = r.R_REGIONKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PARTSUPP ps
  ON s.S_SUPPKEY = ps.PS_SUPPKEY
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.REGION`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PARTSUPP`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

First, determine how to trace the region associated with each line item. You‚Äôll need to join from `LINEITEM` back through `PARTSUPP` ‚Üí `SUPPLIER` ‚Üí `NATION` ‚Üí `REGION`. Then, calculate the total revenue per part within each region. Use `RANK()` with `PARTITION BY region` and `ORDER BY revenue DESC` to select the top 3.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ‚Ä¶ ORDER BY ‚Ä¶)`, CTEs

```sql
SELECT
    REGION,
    P_PARTKEY,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY REGION ORDER BY revenue DESC)
FROM ‚Ä¶;
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH part_region_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        r.R_NAME AS region,
        l.L_PARTKEY,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PARTSUPP ps
      ON l.L_PARTKEY = ps.PS_PARTKEY AND l.L_SUPPKEY = ps.PS_SUPPKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s
      ON ps.PS_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION n
      ON s.S_NATIONKEY = n.N_NATIONKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.REGION r
      ON n.N_REGIONKEY = r.R_REGIONKEY
    GROUP BY r.R_NAME, l.L_PARTKEY
),
ranked_parts AS (
    SELECT
        region,
        L_PARTKEY,
        revenue,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rank_in_region
    FROM part_region_revenue
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_parts
WHERE rank_in_region <= 3
ORDER BY region, rank_in_region;
```

#### Why this works

This query builds a mapping from line items to regions through the supplier hierarchy. It aggregates revenue at the `(region, part)` level, and then ranks parts by revenue within each region. Using `RANK()` makes it easy to pull ties and capture multiple top performers per region.

#### Business answer

You now have a ranked list of the top 3 revenue-generating parts in each region, ready to inform strategic procurement decisions.

#### Take-aways

* Learn to trace geographic metadata through complex joins across entities
* Apply revenue aggregation logic across hierarchical keys
* Practice advanced analytics using `RANK()` with `PARTITION BY`
* Use CTEs to make multi-stage logic readable and performant

Add an additional column showing the **supplier count** per part per region, and return only those parts that are supplied by **at least two suppliers** in that region. This ensures you're highlighting reliably available parts.
