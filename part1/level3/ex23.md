## ex23: Rolling 3-Month Order Momentum by Segment

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 7 / 10

### Business context
The marketing analytics team wants to understand how customer order activity evolves across different market segments. They're especially interested in which segments show sustained momentum ‚Äî not just a big month, but consistently high order activity. To do this, they‚Äôve asked for a report that shows the **3-month rolling average of orders per segment**, so they can compare growth patterns over time.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* order month: truncated order date using `DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', O_ORDERDATE)`
* rolling 3-month order count: total orders placed in the current and prior 2 months
* momentum: segments showing increasing rolling totals indicate consistent engagement

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview order volumes with segment attached
SELECT
    c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    o.O_ORDERDATE,
    o.O_ORDERKEY
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
  ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`

#### How to think about it

First, truncate order dates to the month level. Then group by `C_MKTSEGMENT` and order month to count total orders per segment per month. Apply a `SUM()` window function using `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` to calculate the rolling 3-month total per segment. Sort and compare trends across time.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`DATE_TRUNC`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM() OVER (‚Ä¶)`, `ROWS BETWEEN ‚Ä¶`

```sql
SUM(monthly_orders) OVER (
  PARTITION BY segment
  ORDER BY month
  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH monthly_segment_orders AS (
    SELECT
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT AS segment,
        DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', o.O_ORDERDATE) AS order_month,
        COUNT(*) AS monthly_orders
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
      ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY segment, order_month
),
rolling_orders AS (
    SELECT
        segment,
        order_month,
        monthly_orders,
        SUM(monthly_orders) OVER (
            PARTITION BY segment
            ORDER BY order_month
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS rolling_3mo_orders
    FROM monthly_segment_orders
)
SELECT *
FROM rolling_orders
ORDER BY segment, order_month;
```

#### Why this works

This query computes monthly order totals per segment, then applies a 3-month rolling window using `SUM() OVER (‚Ä¶)` and a row-based frame. This gives a smoothed signal of activity, helping compare ramp-up patterns across different segments.

#### Business answer

You now have a breakdown of how each market segment‚Äôs order activity evolves over time, smoothed over a 3-month horizon. This enables strategic timing for campaigns and reveals momentum trends.

#### Take-aways

* Rolling window functions are ideal for smoothing time-series metrics
* Use `ROWS BETWEEN` instead of `RANGE` for precise control in month-based windows
* You can compare customer behavior across segments with consistent time logic
* Aggregating before applying windows is a powerful compositional pattern

Extend the analysis to compute a **rolling 3-month average order count** (instead of total). Then compare segments by **rate of increase** in rolling average from 1995 to 1996. Which segments are accelerating fastest?
