## ex25: Supplier Discount Outliers ‚Äî Elite Customer Focus

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 9 / 10

### Business context
Building on the elite customer analysis, procurement wants to investigate which suppliers gave **unusually high or low discounts** to those valuable accounts in 1995.

These suppliers could be:
- Undercutting too aggressively (risking margin)
- Overcharging consistently (impacting loyalty)
- Strategically aligned (competitive + fair)

This diagnostic helps flag which suppliers deserve closer inspection ‚Äî especially if they service multiple segments.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Elite customers: customers in the **top 1% of revenue per segment in 1995**
* Supplier discount: average of all `L_DISCOUNT` values for orders tied to those customers
* Outlier: more than **1.5 √ó stddev** above or below the segment-wide mean
* Segment-scope: each supplier is evaluated **per segment**

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview supplier discounts tied to elite customers
SELECT
    s.S_NAME,
    c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    l.L_DISCOUNT,
    o.O_ORDERDATE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON l.L_ORDERKEY = o.O_ORDERKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c ON o.O_CUSTKEY = c.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s ON l.L_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`

#### How to think about it

Reuse the percentile threshold logic from ex24 to isolate elite customers. Then calculate average discount per supplier **per segment**, and compute mean and stddev per segment. Finally, flag those who deviate by more than 1.5 standard deviations from the norm.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`AVG()`, `STDDEV()`, `CASE`, `JOIN`, `PERCENTILE_CONT`

```sql
CASE WHEN avg_discount > threshold THEN 'High Outlier' ‚Ä¶
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH customer_rev AS (
    SELECT
        c.C_CUSTKEY,
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
    GROUP BY c.C_CUSTKEY, c.C_MKTSEGMENT
),
cutoffs AS (
    SELECT
        C_MKTSEGMENT,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS threshold
    FROM customer_rev
    GROUP BY C_MKTSEGMENT
),
elite_customers AS (
    SELECT cr.C_CUSTKEY, cr.C_MKTSEGMENT
    FROM customer_rev cr
    JOIN cutoffs c ON cr.C_MKTSEGMENT = c.C_MKTSEGMENT
    WHERE cr.revenue >= c.threshold
),
supplier_discounts AS (
    SELECT
        s.S_SUPPKEY,
        s.S_NAME,
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        AVG(l.L_DISCOUNT) AS avg_discount
    FROM elite_customers c
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s ON l.L_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
    GROUP BY s.S_SUPPKEY, s.S_NAME, c.C_MKTSEGMENT
),
segment_stats AS (
    SELECT
        C_MKTSEGMENT,
        AVG(avg_discount) AS segment_avg,
        STDDEV(avg_discount) AS segment_std
    FROM supplier_discounts
    GROUP BY C_MKTSEGMENT
)
SELECT
    sd.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    sd.S_NAME,
    sd.avg_discount,
    ss.segment_avg,
    ss.segment_std,
    CASE
        WHEN sd.avg_discount > ss.segment_avg + 1.5 * ss.segment_std THEN 'High Outlier'
        WHEN sd.avg_discount < ss.segment_avg - 1.5 * ss.segment_std THEN 'Low Outlier'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS outlier_flag
FROM supplier_discounts sd
JOIN segment_stats ss ON sd.C_MKTSEGMENT = ss.C_MKTSEGMENT
ORDER BY C_MKTSEGMENT, avg_discount DESC;
```

#### Why this works

By filtering the population to elite customers, the supplier analysis focuses only on **strategically significant transactions**. The statistical outlier logic offers an objective benchmark for pricing review.

#### Business answer

You now know which suppliers provided unusually high or low discounts to the top 1% of customers per segment ‚Äî a powerful signal for auditing margin impact and renegotiation potential.

#### Take-aways

* Learn to **detect statistical outliers** using `AVG()` and `STDDEV()` ‚Äî a key pattern in anomaly detection
* Use **percentile-based filtering** to flexibly define important subpopulations
* Practice **multi-stage query composition** using layered CTEs
