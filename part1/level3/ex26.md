## ex26: Segment Summary Dashboard Payload

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 8 / 10

### Business context
Leadership has asked the analytics team to prepare a **summary dashboard for each market segment**. Rather than producing a static table or Excel sheet, the team needs the data to be structured in a **JSON-like format** so that downstream applications can easily consume it via an API.

The summary should include, for each customer segment:
- Total revenue in 1995
- Average discount given
- Number of **elite customers** (top 0.1% by revenue)
- Number of distinct suppliers who served these elite customers

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Total revenue: `SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT))` for 1995
* Avg discount: `AVG(L_DISCOUNT)` for 1995
* Elite customers: those in the **top 0.1%** of total 1995 customer revenue
* Supplier count: distinct `S_SUPPKEY` values on elite-customer orders
* Payload: JSON-like object per segment with named keys

### Starter query
```sql
-- Inspect order and line-item fields for payload fields
SELECT
    c.C_NAME,
    c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
    o.O_ORDERDATE,
    l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    l.L_DISCOUNT,
    l.L_SUPPKEY
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER`

#### How to think about it

Start by computing customer-level revenue for 1995. Then use `PERCENTILE_CONT()` to find the revenue threshold for the **top 0.1%** of customers. Flag only those elite customers, and use their 1995 orders to count suppliers and segment them.

Use `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT()` to assemble the final payload for each segment.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`OBJECT_CONSTRUCT`, `CTE`, `PERCENTILE_CONT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

```sql
SELECT OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('segment', C_MKTSEGMENT, 'revenue', total_revenue, ...) FROM ‚Ä¶;
```

#### Working query

```sql
WITH customer_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        c.C_CUSTKEY,
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS revenue
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
    GROUP BY c.C_CUSTKEY, c.C_MKTSEGMENT
),
revenue_cutoff AS (
    SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.999) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS revenue_threshold
    FROM customer_revenue
),
top_customers AS (
    SELECT cr.C_CUSTKEY, cr.C_MKTSEGMENT
    FROM customer_revenue cr
    JOIN revenue_cutoff rc ON cr.revenue >= rc.revenue_threshold
),
segment_stats AS (
    SELECT
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        SUM(l.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - l.L_DISCOUNT)) AS total_revenue,
        AVG(l.L_DISCOUNT) AS avg_discount
    FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
    GROUP BY c.C_MKTSEGMENT
),
supplier_counts AS (
    SELECT
        c.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        COUNT(DISTINCT s.S_SUPPKEY) AS supplier_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.C_CUSTKEY) AS top_customer_count
    FROM top_customers c
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.C_CUSTKEY = o.O_CUSTKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM l ON o.O_ORDERKEY = l.L_ORDERKEY
    JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.SUPPLIER s ON l.L_SUPPKEY = s.S_SUPPKEY
    WHERE YEAR(o.O_ORDERDATE) = 1995
    GROUP BY c.C_MKTSEGMENT
)
SELECT
    OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
        'segment', s.C_MKTSEGMENT,
        'total_revenue', ROUND(s.total_revenue, 2),
        'avg_discount', ROUND(s.avg_discount, 4),
        'top_customer_count', sc.top_customer_count,
        'supplier_count', sc.supplier_count
    ) AS segment_payload
FROM segment_stats s
JOIN supplier_counts sc ON s.C_MKTSEGMENT = sc.C_MKTSEGMENT;
```

#### Why this works

By filtering on the **top 0.1% of customers** by revenue, we make the dashboard dynamic and scalable. The query isolates segment-level KPIs and packages them in a structured, JSON-like object, using modular and composable SQL logic.

#### Business answer

You now have a dashboard-ready payload summarizing key performance and supply metrics per segment, focused on the most strategically important customers.

#### Take-aways

* Learn to derive top-N percentiles using `PERCENTILE_CONT()`
* Modularize complex logic with composable CTEs
* Shape outputs using `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT()` for API readiness

Turn this logic into a **stored procedure** that takes a `YEAR` and a `percentile` threshold (e.g. 0.999) as input and returns the segment summary payload for that configuration. Use `RESULTSET` to display the structured JSON per segment.
