## ex05: High-Quantity or Low-Price Lineitems

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
The sales operations team is evaluating candidates for a new bulk discount and price review program. Their goal is to flag line items that suggest either very large order volumes or unusually low total pricesâ€”both potential indicators of wholesale activity or margin erosion.

Based on recent sales data:
- **Orders of 50 units or more** represent the **top ~1%** of quantity volumes,
- **Line items under $10,000** fall within the **bottom ~10%** of total value.

These thresholds will guide which transactions warrant review for new discount tiers or pricing exceptions.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Explore line item quantities and extended prices
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM`

#### How to think about it

You're asked to return line items that satisfy either of two business rules. Use the `OR` operator in your `WHERE` clause to include both cases. These conditions are grounded in the dataset's real distributionâ€”try to reason from the data rather than guess.

Also be careful with `OR` versus `AND`, and remember to use parentheses when combining conditions in more complex filters.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WHERE`, `OR`

```sql
SELECT â€¦ FROM â€¦ WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_QUANTITY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
WHERE L_QUANTITY >= 50
   OR L_EXTENDEDPRICE < 10000;
```

#### Why this works

This query retrieves line items that meet either the high-quantity (â‰¥ 50 units) or low-price (< $10,000) thresholds, based on quantiles in the actual data:
- `L_QUANTITY >= 50` flags the top ~1% of volume,
- `L_EXTENDEDPRICE < 10000` catches the lowest ~10% of price values.

Using `OR` ensures that if either condition is true, the record is included.

#### Business answer

Line items at the extreme ends of quantity or price distribution were identified and are now ready for discount and pricing policy review.

#### Take-aways

* Use data-backed thresholds for filtersâ€”percentiles can guide realistic cutoffs.
* The `OR` operator helps define inclusive business rules.
* Parentheses can clarify more complex logic when `AND` and `OR` are mixed.
* Always inspect the underlying data to avoid arbitrary cutoffs.
