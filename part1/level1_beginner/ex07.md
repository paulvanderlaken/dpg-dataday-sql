## ex07: Sort Parts by Size and Name

> **Type:** Stretch  
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
The parts catalog team is reviewing entries to ensure consistency in product naming across similar sizes. To assist, they need a list of parts sorted first by size (to group similar items together), and then by name (to spot any irregularities or naming conventions).

### Starter query
```sql
-- Check available part size and name data
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME,
    P_SIZE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`

#### How to think about it

This exercise is all about ordering results. Youâ€™re asked to sort by two columns: one numeric (size), one text (name). SQL lets you layer sorting criteria by listing them in order of priority using `ORDER BY col1, col2`.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`ORDER BY`

```sql
SELECT â€¦ FROM â€¦ ORDER BY col1, col2;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME,
    P_SIZE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
ORDER BY P_SIZE, P_NAME;
```

#### Why this works

The `ORDER BY` clause first sorts parts by `P_SIZE` (ascending by default), grouping items of the same size. Within each size group, it further sorts by `P_NAME`, making it easier to visually inspect for naming inconsistencies or patterns.

#### Business answer

Parts are now listed in order of size and then alphabetically by name, allowing a structured catalog review.

#### Take-aways

* `ORDER BY` can accept multiple columns to create layered sorting.
* Sorting alphabetically within numeric groups is useful for audits and pattern detection.
* Always be clear on whether default ascending order is acceptableâ€”or explicitly state `ASC`/`DESC`.
