## ex07: Find Smallest Parts with Longest Names

> **Type:** Stretch  
>
> **Difficulty:** 3 / 10

### Business context
The parts catalog team wants to clean up naming conventions for small parts, especially those with long or inconsistent names. To prioritize the cleanup, they‚Äôd like a list of the **smallest parts**, but only those with the **longest product names** ‚Äî these are usually the hardest to read and standardize.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* small part: `P_SIZE`
* long name: use `P_NAME` to derive name length

### Starter query
```sql
-- Explore part sizes and name lengths
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME,
    P_SIZE,
    LENGTH(P_NAME) AS name_length
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`

#### How to think about it

You‚Äôll need to:
1. Use a function to calculate the number of characters in the part name
2. Include this derived column in your `SELECT` clause
3. Sort first by `P_SIZE ASC` and then by `name_length DESC`
4. Limit to 10 rows to keep results focused

Derived columns like `LENGTH(P_NAME)` can be used directly in `ORDER BY`, or aliased and reused.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`LENGTH()`, column aliases, mixed sort order

```sql
SELECT column1, LENGTH(column2) AS len
FROM table
ORDER BY column1 ASC, len DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME,
    P_SIZE,
    LENGTH(P_NAME) AS name_length
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
ORDER BY P_SIZE ASC, name_length DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Why this works

This query finds the smallest parts first, but when multiple parts share the same size, it prefers the ones with the **longest names**. This helps prioritize which small parts might be messiest to clean up based on naming complexity.

#### Business answer

This sample gives the catalog team a high-priority list of small, long-named parts to review for potential renaming.

#### Take-aways

* You can derive new columns using functions like `LENGTH()` right in `SELECT`
* Aliases (`AS`) make derived columns easier to reuse and interpret
* `ORDER BY` can mix directions: `ASC` for one field, `DESC` for another
* Sorting on derived columns is a powerful way to combine business logic and data shaping

<summary>üéÅ Bonus Exercise (click to expand)</summary>

Instead of sorting by part size, try finding the **longest names overall**, regardless of size.

Then:
- Return the top 15 parts sorted by name length (descending),
- Only include names longer than 25 characters.

This helps you chain: derived field ‚Üí filter ‚Üí sort ‚Üí limit.
