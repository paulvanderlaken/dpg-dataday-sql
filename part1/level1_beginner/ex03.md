## ex03: Top 3 Orders from the BUILDING Segment

> **Type:** Core  
>
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
The sales team is evaluating opportunities within the BUILDING segment. They want to quickly identify the three highest-value orders placed by customers in this segment, to understand what large-scale deals look like in this category.

**Business logic & definitions:**
* Customer segment: defined in `CUSTOMER.C_MKTSEGMENT`
* Order value: stored in `ORDERS.O_TOTALPRICE`
* Top 3 orders: select orders by `'BUILDING'` segment customers, sorted by `O_TOTALPRICE` descending, and take the top three

### Starter query
```sql
-- Explore how orders and customers connect, including total price and segment
SELECT
    O_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_TOTALPRICE,
    C_NAME,
    C_MKTSEGMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
    ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`
* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER`

#### How to think about it

Start by joining `ORDERS` and `CUSTOMER` on the customer key. Then filter for rows where the customer's market segment is `'BUILDING'`. To find the largest orders, sort the results by `O_TOTALPRICE` in descending order, and use `LIMIT 3` to get just the top three.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`JOIN`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`

```sql
SELECT ‚Ä¶
FROM A
JOIN B ON A.id = B.id
WHERE B.segment = 'BUILDING'
ORDER BY A.total DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    O.O_ORDERKEY,
    O.O_ORDERDATE,
    O.O_TOTALPRICE,
    C.C_NAME,
    C.C_MKTSEGMENT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS O
JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER C
    ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
WHERE C.C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'
ORDER BY O.O_TOTALPRICE DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Why this works

This query filters the full list of orders to only those placed by BUILDING segment customers. It then sorts by total price in descending order and picks the top three, allowing the team to quickly identify the largest transactions in that segment.

#### Business answer

The three most valuable orders by BUILDING segment customers are now listed with full customer and order detail.

#### Take-aways

* You‚Äôve combined filtering (`WHERE`) and sorting (`ORDER BY`) after a `JOIN`
* You used `LIMIT` to return only the top-N records ‚Äî a very common analytical pattern
* Always remember to apply `LIMIT` *after* sorting to ensure meaningful results
* Use aliases like `O` and `C` to keep queries readable when multiple tables are involved

What if we also wanted to see *who the supplier was* for the parts used in those top 3 orders?

Extend your query by also joining the `LINEITEM` table and selecting `L_SUPPKEY` to see which suppliers fulfilled those high-value orders. You can start by joining `ORDERS ‚Üí LINEITEM` using `O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY`.

This will let you trace which suppliers were involved in the biggest BUILDING segment deals.
