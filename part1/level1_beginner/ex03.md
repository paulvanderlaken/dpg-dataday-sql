## ex03: Orders in Q1 1995

> **Type:** Core  
> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
The finance and planning department is preparing an audit of seasonal trends in customer demand. To compare Q1 activity across years, they need to extract a clean snapshot of all orders placed during the first quarter of 1995. This will help validate assumptions on seasonal sales peaks and assess whether fulfillment operations matched demand during that period.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview the order data table
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS`

#### How to think about it

Youâ€™re looking for orders placed between January 1st and March 31st of 1995. Use a `WHERE` clause that filters `O_ORDERDATE` with a `BETWEEN` condition. Be precise with date literals â€” they should match the format used in the dataset. 

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `DATE literals`

```sql
SELECT â€¦ FROM â€¦ WHERE date_column BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31';
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    O_ORDERKEY,
    O_ORDERDATE,
    O_CUSTKEY
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
WHERE O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31';
```

#### Why this works

This query filters the `ORDERS` table for rows where `O_ORDERDATE` falls between two specified dates. The `BETWEEN` operator includes both endpoints, ensuring all Q1 orders are captured. The selected columns give a basic structure for analysis or join extensions later on.

#### Business answer

All orders placed between January 1st and March 31st, 1995, are now available for seasonal demand analysis.

#### Take-aways

* Use `BETWEEN` to express inclusive date ranges cleanly.
* Always check date format compatibility with your SQL engine.
* Early filtering on date ranges helps scope large datasets for time-specific audits.
