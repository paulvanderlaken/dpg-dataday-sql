## ex10: Compute Price with Tax and Discount

> **Difficulty:** 2 / 10

### Business context
Finance is modeling gross-to-net revenue transitions as part of a new tax compliance analysis. To get an initial sense of scale, they want to see the full price breakdown per line item: the raw extended price, the post-discount value, and a hypothetical 15% tax applied on top of the raw price. This will allow them to separate the effects of discounts and tax on overall revenue, and serve as input to their revenue forecasting model.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview key price components to be modeled
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_SUPPKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE,
    L_DISCOUNT
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

#### How to think about it

Break the calculation into two parts:
- First, compute the net revenue after applying the discount. The discount is given as a decimal (e.g., 0.04 = 4%), so subtract it from 1 and multiply it by the base price.
- Then separately compute the taxed amount as 15% on the original base priceâ€”ignore the discount when computing tax, as this simulation assumes the tax is applied on list prices.

Return all three: original price, discounted price, and taxed price.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

```sql
SELECT column, column * (1 - discount), column * 1.15 FROM â€¦;

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    L_ORDERKEY,
    L_PARTKEY,
    L_SUPPKEY,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE AS ORIGINAL_PRICE,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT) AS PRICE_AFTER_DISCOUNT,
    L_EXTENDEDPRICE * 1.15 AS PRICE_WITH_TAX
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM;
```

#### Why this works

This query outputs three columns:
- The original price (`L_EXTENDEDPRICE`),
- The price after applying the discount (`L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)`),
- The price if a 15% tax were applied to the original price (`L_EXTENDEDPRICE * 1.15`).

By keeping these separate, finance can analyze the contribution of both pricing leversâ€”discount and taxâ€”without them interfering with each other.

#### Business answer

This provides a side-by-side view of pricing before and after discount, and what taxation on gross prices would look likeâ€”offering clear input into revenue simulation models.

#### Take-aways

* `L_EXTENDEDPRICE` is the base line-item price before discounts or taxes.
* Discounts reduce price by multiplying by `(1 - discount rate)`.
* Hypothetical tax can be simulated with a multiplication (e.g., `* 1.15` for 15%).
* Even simple math becomes powerful when paired with real-world assumptions and business logic.
