## ex04: Project Part Attributes

> **Type:** Core  
> **Difficulty:** 1 / 10

### Business context
The procurement team is updating the product catalog system and needs a quick reference of key part attributes. To start, they want to extract a table of part IDs, names, and sizes â€” essential information for matching supplier specs, reviewing size-based pricing policies, and identifying naming inconsistencies in the database.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview of the PART data table
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`

#### How to think about it

This task is about selecting only the columns you need â€” no filtering, no sorting. Just project a subset of attributes from a table. Focus on column selection and understanding what each field represents.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`SELECT`, column projection

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME,
    P_SIZE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART;
```

#### Why this works

This simple query selects three relevant columns from the `PART` table. No filtering or transformation is applied â€” it's a clean projection of available data for inspection or export. It helps analysts focus on specific attributes without unnecessary noise.

#### Business answer

You now have a list of all parts along with their identifiers, names, and sizes â€” ready for catalog alignment or data validation tasks.

#### Take-aways

* Use `SELECT` to project only the columns you care about.
* Column projection keeps queries efficient and readable.
* Knowing which attributes are relevant saves time in larger datasets.
