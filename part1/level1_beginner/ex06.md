## ex06: Sample Five Parts

> **Type:** Stretch  
> **Difficulty:** 1 / 10

### Business context
The procurement team is setting up a dashboard to validate data ingestion from a new supplier system. Before deeper analysis, they want to quickly eyeball a few part entries to ensure everything looks as expected and that the dataset has loaded properly.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Quick glance at parts dataset
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME,
    P_SIZE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
LIMIT 10;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART`

#### How to think about it

This is a very simple inspection task. You don't need to filter, sort, or join anything. Just display any 5 rows to confirm the dataset is present and readable. `LIMIT` helps you cap the number of records returnedâ€”ideal for sanity checks or previews.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`LIMIT`

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name LIMIT 5;
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    P_PARTKEY,
    P_NAME,
    P_SIZE
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.PART
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Why this works

This query retrieves just five arbitrary rows from the `PART` table, using the `LIMIT` clause to control output size. No `ORDER BY` is specified, so the rows returned may vary between executions depending on Snowflake's internal storage.

#### Business answer

The part dataset loads correctly and contains entries such as part keys, names, and sizesâ€”ready for further use.

#### Take-aways

* Use `LIMIT` to quickly preview data during exploratory work.
* Omitting `ORDER BY` means results are non-deterministicâ€”fine for sampling, but not for analysis.
* Small previews are efficient and reduce unnecessary compute and scrolling when validating data presence.
