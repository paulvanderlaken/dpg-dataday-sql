### Business context
The legal team is preparing a regional compliance review and wants to focus on countries whose names begin with the letter "U". To get started, they need a filtered list of nations from the reference data.

### Starter query
```sql
-- Preview nations dataset
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION
LIMIT 5;
```

### Required datasets

* `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION`

#### How to think about it

You need to match a string pattern‚Äîspecifically, names that *start* with a certain letter. The `LIKE` operator in SQL allows for simple wildcard pattern matching. Use `%` to represent any sequence of characters. `%` at the end means ‚Äústarts with‚Äù.

#### Helpful SQL concepts

`LIKE`

```sql
SELECT ‚Ä¶ FROM ‚Ä¶ WHERE column LIKE 'U%';
```

#### Working query

```sql
SELECT
    N_NATIONKEY,
    N_NAME
FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION
WHERE N_NAME LIKE 'U%';
```

#### Why this works

The `LIKE 'U%'` clause matches any nation name that begins with the letter "U", regardless of what follows. It filters down the full country list to just those relevant for the legal team‚Äôs scope.

#### Business answer

The nations beginning with ‚ÄúU‚Äù have been successfully identified and extracted from the reference data.

#### Take-aways

* `LIKE` is great for simple pattern matching; `%` represents any string of characters.
* Case sensitivity may vary by SQL dialect‚ÄîSnowflake is case-insensitive by default.
* Always verify pattern logic when filtering text fields to avoid subtle mismatches.
